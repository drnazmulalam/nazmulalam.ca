	abstract = {Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a group of antimicrobial agents that have been widely used for therapeutic purposes in clinical medicine for human and veterinary diseases, as well as in aquaculture production. Their residues, however, may survive in foods of animal origin, thus causing health risks for human. In this study, a rapid and sensitive method based on in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed to detect the residues of five FQs in cultured puffer fish (Takifugu obscurus). In vitro fiber evaluation experiment demonstrated that, compared with the thicker polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating (165µm), the custom-made biocompatible C18-PAN fibers (45µm) exhibited much higher extraction efficiencies towards FQs (approximately 9–31 times). The custom-made C18-PAN coating also possessed excellent reproducibility in fish muscle with the intra-fiber relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging from 11.2\% to 14.3\% (n = 6) and inter-fiber RSDs ranging from 13.1\% to 16.1\% (n = 6), which was suitable for in vivo sampling. The custom-made SPME fibers were subsequently applied to determine fluoroquinolones in dorsal-epaxial muscle of living puffer fish. The accuracies were verified through the comparison with traditional liquid extraction (LE) method, and the sensitivities were demonstrated to be satisfying with the limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 0.3ngg−1 to 1.5ngg−1. In general, this study presented a convenient and high-efficient method to determine fluoroquinolones in puffer fish by in vivo sampling.},

	abstract = {Knowledge gaps related to mass transfer processes involved in passive air sampling of semivolatile organic compounds and factors potentially influencing passive sampling rates (PSRs) were addressed with controlled laboratory experiments, mass transfer modeling, and a field sampling campaign. The observed non-uniform SVOC distributions within porous passive sampling media (PSMs) contradict an assumption in an earlier passive air sampling theory and proved the existence of a kinetic resistance on the PSM side. This resistance can affect PSRs as revealed by a new PAS model which is based on fundamental laws of mass transfer in air and porous media. By considering mass transfer processes within the PSM, the model is able to explain the large variations of field calibrated PSRs with temperature and between SVOC species and the two-stage uptake process, which cannot be addressed by the earlier PAS theory. Because the PSM side kinetic resistance invalidates the assumption that depuration compounds added to the PSM prior to deployment are subject to the same kinetic resistance as the sampled SVOCs, PSRs derived from the loss rates of depuration compounds can differ from the actual PSRs of the sampled SVOCs. Using such PSRs could thus introduce additional uncertainty to PAS-derived air concentrations. 
Experiments using XAD-resin and silica-gel filled mesh cylinder as PSMs for the uptake of SVOCs and water vapor respectively revealed  that sorbent in the inner portion of the PSM does not take part in chemical uptake; PSRs are thus proportional to the interfacial transfer area but not the amount of the sorbent. Accordingly, thinner PSM can be used to reduce the amount of sorbent while keeping or even increasing the PSRs. Optimized designs of PASs could be tested time efficiently using the gravimetrical approach based on water vapor uptake by silica gel.},

	abstract = {Solid phase microextraction (SPME) has been widely used in a variety of sample matrices and proven to be a simple, fast and solvent-free sample preparation technique. A challenging limitation in the further development of this technique has been the insufficient sensitivity for some trace applications. This limitation lies mainly in the small volume of the extraction phase. According to the fundamentals of SPME, different strategies can be employed to achieve higher sensitivity for SPME sampling. These include cooling down the extraction phase, preparing a high capacity particle-loading extraction phase, as well as using a thin film with high surface area-to-volume ratio as the extraction phase. In this thesis, four sampling approaches were developed for high sensitivity sampling by employing cold fiber, thin film, cooling membrane and particle loading membrane as sampling tools. These proposed methods were applied to liquid, solid and particularly trace gas analysis. 
First, a fully automated cold fiber device that improves the sensitivity of the technique by cooling down the extraction phase was developed. This device was coupled to a GERSTEL® MultiPurpose Sampler (MPS 2), and applied to the analysis of volatiles and semi-volatiles in aqueous and solid matrices. The proposed device was thoroughly evaluated for its extraction performance, robustness, reproducibility and reliability by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The evaluation of the automated cold fiber device was carried out using a group of compounds characterized by different volatilities and polarities. Extraction efficiency and analytical figures of merit were compared to commercial SPME fibers. In the analysis of aqueous standard samples, the automated cold fiber device showed a significant improvement in extraction efficiency when compared to commercial polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and non-cooled cold fiber. This was achieved due to the low temperature of the coating during sampling. Results from the cold fiber and commercial divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber analysis of solid sample matrices were obtained and compared. Results demonstrated that the temperature gap between the sample matrix and the coating significantly improved the distribution coefficient, and consequently, the extraction amount. The newly automated cold fiber device presents a platform for headspace analysis of volatiles and semi-volatiles for a large number of samples, with improved throughput and sensitivity.
Thin film microextraction (TFME) improves the sensitivity by employing a membrane with a high surface area-to-volume ratio as the extraction phase. In Chapter 3, a simple non-invasive sample preparation method using TFME is proposed for sampling volatile skin emissions. Evaluation experiments were conducted to test the reproducibility of the sampling device, the effect of the membrane size, and the method for storage. Results supported the reproducibility of multi-membrane sampling, and demonstrated that sampling efficiency can be improved using a larger membrane. However, ability to control the sampling environment and time was proved to be critical in order to obtain reliable information; the in vivo skin emission sampling was also influenced by skin metabolism and environmental conditions. Next, the method of storage was fully investigated for the membrane device before and after sampling. This investigation of storage permitted the sampling and instrument analysis to be conducted at different locations. Finally, the developed skin sampling device was applied in the identification of dietary biomarkers after garlic and alcohol ingestion. In this experiment, the previously reported potential biomarkers dimethyl sulphone, allyl methyl sulfide and allyl mercaptan were detected after garlic intake, and ethanol was detected after the ingestion of alcohol. Experiments were also conducted in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from upper back, forearm and back thigh of the body on the same individual. Results showed that 27 compounds can be detected from all of the 3 locations. However, these compounds were quantitatively different. In addition, sampling of the upper back, where the density of sebaceous glands is relatively high, detected more compounds than the other regions.      
In Chapter 4, a novel sample preparation method that combines the advantages of cold fiber and thin film was developed to achieve the high extraction efficiency necessary for high sensitivity gas sampling. A cooling sampling device was developed for the thin film microextraction. Method development for this sampling approach included evaluation of membrane temperature effect, membrane size effect, air flow rate and humidity effect. Results showed that high sensitivity for equilibrium sampling can be achieved by either cooling down the membrane and/or using a large volume extraction phase. On the other hand, for pre-equilibrium extraction, in which the extracted amount was mainly determined by membrane surface area and diffusion coefficient, high sensitivity was obtained by thin membranes with a large surface area and/or high sampling flow rate. In addition, humidity evaluations showed no significant effect on extraction efficiency due to the absorption property of the liquid extraction phase. Next, the limit of detection (LOD) and reproducibility of the developed cooling membrane gas sampling method were evaluated. LOD with a membrane radius of 1 cm at room temperature sampling were 9.24 ng/L, 0.12 ng/L, 0.10 ng/L for limonene, cinnamaldehyde and 2-pentadecanone, respectively. Intra- and inter-membrane sampling reproducibility had a relative standard deviation (RSD\%) lower than 8\% and 13\%, respectively. Results uniformly demonstrated that the proposed cooling membrane device could serve as a powerful tool for gas in trace analysis.
  In Chapter 5, a particle-loading membrane was developed to combine advantages of high distribution coefficient and high surface area geometry, and applied in trace gas sampling. Bar coating, a simple and easy preparation method was applied in the preparation of the DVB/PDMS membrane. Membrane morphology, particle ratio, membrane size and extraction efficiency were fully evaluated for the prepared membrane. Results show that the DVB particles are uniformly distributed in the PDMS base. The addition of a DVB particle enhanced the stiffness of the membrane to some extent, and improved the extraction capacity of the membrane. Extraction capacity for benzene was enhanced by a factor of 100 when the membrane DVB particle ratio increased from 0\% to 30\%. Additionally, the prepared DVB/PDMS membrane provided higher extraction efficiency than pure PDMS membrane and DVB/PDMS fiber, especially for highly volatile and polar compounds. The high reproducibility of the prepared DVB/PDMS membrane in air sampling demonstrated the advantage of the bar coating preparation method, and also permitted quantitative analysis. Last, the prepared particle-loading membrane was applied to semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis of indoor and outdoor air, respectively. Both the equilibrium calibration method and diffusion-based calibration method were proposed for the quantitative analysis. Results showed that the high capacity particle-loading membrane can be used for monitoring trace analytes such as perfume components and air pollutants.},

	url = {https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/11766},
	abstract = {Due to the wide spread use of pharmaceuticals in both human and animal populations, the contamination of surface waters resulting from the outflow of waste water treatment facilities is of growing concern. Conventional methods used for the determination of these compounds often require extensive sample preparation in order to achieve appropriate limits of detection and quantitation. As a result, analytical methods which utilize these procedures are limited in their throughput capacity, while also generating large volumes of solvent waste. Coated blade spray (CBS) is a solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique which enables the direct to mass spectrometry analysis of extracted compounds with the application of limited organic solvent in order to desorb analyte and perform electrospray ionization. Demonstrated herein is the application of CBS for the concomitant MS/MS analysis of 12 pharmaceuticals in environmental waters which was able to demonstrate LODs for all compounds at concentrations of less than 50 ng/L while employing a 30 second analysis time. As select pharmaceuticals are susceptible to bioaccumulation, the analysis of fish tissue as a marker of environmental pollution is also an area of interest. For this reason a device was developed, the SPME needle, which is able to perform rapid tissue analysis without the need for a protective sheathing needle or house, simplifying the sampling process. The device was further validated to be reproducible and not effected by puncture through protective tissue. Finally, the device was incorporated into a projectile which was validated to enable rapid one handed SPME sampler administration in a matter of seconds in an on-site proof of concept.},

	abstract = {In chemical analysis, sample preparation is frequently considered the bottleneck of the entire analytical method. The success of the final method strongly depends on understanding the entire process of analysis of a particular type of analyte in a sample, namely: the physicochemical properties of the analytes (solubility, volatility, polarity etc.), the environmental conditions, and the matrix components of the sample. Various sample preparation strategies have been developed based on exhaustive or non-exhaustive extraction of analytes from matrices. Undoubtedly, amongst all sample preparation approaches, liquid extraction, including liquid–liquid (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE), are the most well-known, widely used, and commonly accepted methods by many international organizations and accredited laboratories. Both methods are well documented and there are many well defined procedures, which make them, at first sight, the methods of choice. However, many challenging tasks, such as complex matrix applications, on-site and in vivo applications, and determination of matrix-bound and free concentrations of analytes, are not easily attainable with these classical approaches for sample preparation. In the last two decades, the introduction of solid phase microextraction (SPME) has brought significant progress in the sample preparation area by facilitating on-site and in vivo applications, time weighted average (TWA) and instantaneous concentration determinations. Recently introduced matrix compatible coatings for SPME facilitate direct extraction from complex matrices and fill the gap in direct sampling from challenging matrices. Following introduction of SPME, numerous other microextraction approaches evolved to address limitations of the above mentioned techniques. There is not a single method that can be considered as a universal solution for sample preparation. This review aims to show the main advantages and limitations of the above mentioned sample preparation approaches and the applicability and capability of each technique for challenging cases such as complex matrices, on-site applications and automation.},

A new thin film active sampler was then developed for rapid on-site water sampling. The sampling kit included a portable electric drill, a copper mesh pocket, a piece of thin film, and a liner. Laboratory experiments indicated that the sampling remained in the linear uptake phase with this sampler to 8 min for the PAHs. Field test illustrated that this novel sampler was excellent for rapid on-site water sampling due to its short sampling period, high sampling efficiency and durability The thin film sampling kit facilitates on-site sampling, sample preparation, storage and transport. This new sampler is more user-friendly and easier to commercialize than previous samplers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A new configuration of C18 thin film extraction phase designed for high sample throughput has been developed and applied to the analysis of benzodiazepines in spiked urine samples using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The high throughput analysis was achieved with the use of a robotic autosampler which enabled parallel analyte extraction in a 96-well plate format. Factors affecting data reproducibility, extraction kinetics, sample throughput, and reliability of the system were investigated and optimized. The intrawell reproducibility was 4.5-7.3\%, while interwell reproducibility was 7.0-11\% in urine and PBS samples. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0.05-0.15 ng/mL and 0.2-2.0 ng/mL for all analytes, respectively. By comparison with optimized automated multifiber SPME relying on rod geometry, the C18 thin films showed higher extraction rates (approximate 2-fold increase) and hence higher sample throughput because of the improved configuration and more effective agitation/mass transfer. In addition, this new configuration provided an extraction phase with greater surface area to volume ratio and greater extraction phase volume, which resulted in approximately 2-fold increase in the extraction capacity for diazepam compared with the extractions with automated multifiber SPME rod geometry. The results of this investigation demonstrated the advantages of using thin films to improve extraction kinetics and sensitivity of automated SPME methods for high performance liquid chromatography. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The main objective of the chapter is to provide unified theory of extraction and simple approach to classification of the techniques. It emphasizes the fundamental similarities between techniques. Theory presented in this chapter developed by applying basic fundamentals of thermodynamics and mass transfer provides insight and direction when developing sample preparation methods and identifies parameters for rigorous control and optimisation. Effective use of the theory minimises the number of experiments that need to be performed. Headspace extractions and matrix compatible extraction phases and approaches are discussed in view of potential complications, which are typically observed when extracting analytes from complex matrices including competition among different phases for the analyte and fouling of the extraction phase, due to adsorption of macromolecules, such as proteins and humic materials, at the interface. The other critical optimization to be addressed in extraction method development is the properties of the extraction phase which should be carefully optimised, because they determine the selectivity and reliability of the method. Kinetics of extraction are discussed using theory of mass transfer at solid interfaces, which identifies extraction rate “bottlenecks” of solid phase microextraction and therefore indicates strategies to increase speed of extraction. New developments in the extraction technology making it more environmentally friendly, efficient and cost effective are emphasized.},

Dynamic non-equilibrium solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for air sampling, in combination with GC/PICI and ion trap tandem MS, yields a fast, almost solvent-free method with low detection limits. Methanol was used as reagent gas for PICI, yielding stable protonated molecules and few fragments. A field sampler, in which a pumped airflow over three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 100-μm fibers in series was applied, was constructed, evaluated, and used for the measurements. The method LODs were in the range 2–26 ng m−3 for a sampling period of 2 h. The uptake on the SPME fibers was shown to be about five times faster for triphenyl phosphate compared to the other investigated organophosphate esters, most likely due to more lipophilic properties of the aromatic compound. The boundary layer for triphenyl phosphate when using a 100-µm PDMS sorbent was determined to 0.08 mm at a linear air velocity of 34 cm s−1. Five different organophosphate triesters were detected in air from a laboratory and a lecture hall, at concentrations ranging from 7 ng m−3 up to 2.8 μg m−3.},

	abstract = {Adsorbent-packed preconcentrators are essential elements of most microanalytical systems designed for monitoring airborne volatile organic compounds (VOC) at low concentrations. These devices also serve as thermally desorbed injectors that transfer focused bands of captured VOCs to downstream separation and/or detection modules. Despite their importance, the factors affecting the capture efficiency of such devices have not been extensively or systematically studied. In this study, the dynamic retention capacities of four deep-reactive-ion-etched Si micropreconcentrator-focusers (μPCF) packed with a commercial graphitized carbon, Carbopack X (C-X), were characterized for several VOCs and compared to those of a reference capillary preconcentrator-focuser (cPCF). Devices were challenged with {\textasciitilde}100 parts-per-billion of benzene, 2-butanone, toluene, or n-heptane in dry N2 over a range of volumetric flow rates, Q. The relationships between the bed residence time, τ, and the 10\% breakthrough volume and breakthrough time (Vb−10 and tb−10, respectively) were evaluated in the context of the modified Wheeler Model. Both Vb−10 and tb−10 decrease monotonically with decreasing τ, in accordance with the model. The performance of the largest μPCF, packed with 2.3mg of C-X, was comparable to that of the reference cPCF packed with a similar quantity of C-X. The critical flow rates, Qc−10, corresponding to immediate breakthrough, ranged from 70 to 290mL/min and varied directly with the affinity of the vapor for the adsorbent. As a practical operating guideline, it is recommended that flow rates be limited to {\textless}0.4Qc for reliable performance of any μPCF used for quantitative analysis. Estimated preconcentration factors range from 730 to 39,000. Challenges to predicting device performance via the modified Wheeler Model are illustrated.},

We discuss and compare several aspects of these types of SPME in on-site applications. We also describe sorbent phases for SPME that benefit on-site applications.

A standard generation chamber was built in the laboratory and was used to test the SPME. Analysis SPME samples were carried out by a gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry and results were compared with data obtained with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) method 1600. Polymethylsiloxane-carboxen (PDMS/CAR) showed  the  most  effective stationary phase  material for sorbing BTEX among other materials (polyacrylate, PDMS, PDMS/divinylbenzene). Its linearity range in exposed mode was less than 10 minutes but with its retracted mode application, its linearity increased up to 8 hours. Temperature had not linear effect on uptake of pollutant in temperatures lower than 25, it has positive effect and above this range it has negative effect. Relative humidity had negative effect on mass loaded on fiber. Velocity in range of static to 0.5 m/s had no significant effect. The precision of the method was 4.18\% relative standard deviation (RSD). The detection limit for carbon disulfide in the GC/MS system in SIM mode was 6.7 ng per sample. SPME is a good alternative for sampling of carbon disulfide in air. However, for the situations in high humidity values it should be used with care.},

This study examines the value of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for sampling perchlorethylene in the atmosphere of dry cleaning shops. Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) in 0.5-cm retracted mode was selected. There were no significant differences between sampling rates at different temperatures (range of 20 to 30 °C) and air velocities (2 to 50 cm/s). On the opposite, relative humidity (RH) had a significant effect on sampling rates. Method reproducibility was realized in the laboratory and field conditions and was 6.2 \% and 7 to 11 \%, respectively. Repeatability was also determined as 8.9 \%. Comparison of the results according to the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure assessment strategy showed the SPME sampler yields more conservative results in comparison with traditional standard method.},

The present work developed a novel solid phase microextraction (SPME) method for time weighted average determination of epichlorohydrin in the air by GC/MS. CAR/PDMS in 0.5 cm retracted mode was selected and the effect of environmental parameters on sampling properties of SPME was examined. Experimental sampling rate for epichlorohydrin (8.89 × 10−3 cm3/min) was slightly less than theoretical value (9.059 × 10−3 cm3/min). There was no significant difference among sampling rates at different temperature and velocities but relative humidity had a significant effect on the sampling rate. Limit of detection for SPME method was 0.8 ng per sample, which is good enough in comparison with the NIOSH 1010 method. Comparison of the results between the developed SPME and the NIOSH 1010 method on standard test atmosphere and field showed satisfactory agreement (y = 1.162x + 1.8 r 2 = 0.992 and y = 1.009x+0.76 r 2 = 0.98 respectively).},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a powerful technique, easy to implement for on-site static sampling of indoor VOCs emitted by building materials. However, a major constraint lies in the establishment of calibration curves which requires complex generation of standard atmospheres. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to propose a model to predict adsorption kinetics (i.e., calibration curves) of four model VOCs. The model is based on Fick’s laws for the gas phase and on the equilibrium or the solid diffusion model for the adsorptive phase. Two samplers (the FLEC® and a home-made cylindrical emission cell), coupled to SPME for static sampling of material emissions, were studied. A good agreement between modeling and experimental data is observed and results show the influence of sampling rate on mass transfer mode in function of sample volume. The equilibrium model is adapted to quite large volume sampler (cylindrical cell) while the solid diffusion model is dedicated to small volume sampler (FLEC®). The limiting steps of mass transfer are the diffusion in gas phase for the cylindrical cell and the pore surface diffusion for the FLEC®. In the future, this modeling approach could be a useful tool for time-saving development of SPME to study building material emission in static mode sampling.},

	abstract = {For low volatile pesticides, the applications of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) as an air sampler were reported with sampling time chosen in the linear stage of the sorption kinetics because of long equilibrium time. In these pre-equilibrium conditions, sampling rates (SRs) expressed as the volume of air sampled by the SPME sampler per unit of time, were used to estimate analytes concentrations in air. In the present study, to achieve good extraction performance and accurate calibration, the sorption kinetics of several pesticides with SPME were investigated in detail, with a focus on parameters influencing SRs. Linear air velocity was found to be the main parameter affecting SRs. For exposed fibers, with air velocities below 20–25cms−1, SRs increased with increasing air velocity. When linear air velocity was equal to or greater than 25–30cms−1, it had little effect on SRs. To improve the flexibility of SPME, different configurations of SPME were compared, i.e. different lengths of fibers exposed, retracted fibers, exposed fibers with grids. SRs were linearly proportional to exposed lengths of fibers. Using grids, lower SRs and wider calibration time range were achieved. SRs for retracted fibers were the lowest among the different experimented configurations. The accuracy of calibration was improved and more flexibility of SPME was provided.},

The device involves an emission cell coupled with solid phase microextraction (SPME) for diffusive sampling. Owing to possible competitive adsorption of VOCs onto the PDMS–Carboxen fiber used, the co-adsorption conditions were determined through kinetics study of isolated and in mixture compounds. Hence, the linear concentration ranges which ensure reliable quantification were determined from 4.8 to 10mgm−3min according to the VOC studied. Thus, the analyst can select the extraction time that fits for his best analytical objectives. For example, sub μgm−3 limits of detection can be achieved for GC–MS analysis for 20min extraction. On the other hand, 5min sampling is sufficient for a rapid screening of the major emitted VOCs, since the average limit of quantification reaches 20μgm−3 for GC-FID analysis.},

We propose here a theoretical model of the adsorption kinetics of toluene on SPME fibre under static extraction conditions. We discuss the effects of sampling volume and initial concentration of analyte on the adsorption kinetics. This model is used to estimate the limits of detection taking into account operating conditions and to calculate theoretical calibration curves. Results of comparison with experimental data are encouraging: only 11\% difference for calibration curves and 30\% for the estimation of the limit of detection. On the basis of this kinetics model, the solid concentration gradient in the Carboxen coating was modelled with Fick’s second law of diffusion in unsteady-state mass-transfer mode. Mass diffusion from the gas sample to the SPME fibre was also investigated. It was shown that diffusion is the limiting step of the mass-transfer process in the static mode. Thus, the model developed, allows a better understanding of adsorption on Carboxen fibre and in the future could be a useful tool for cheap and time-saving development of SPME methods and the estimation of sampling performance.Open image in new windowFigurePDMS/Carboxen SPME fibre (scanning electron microscopy – magnification x 220)},

	abstract = {Solid phase microextraction (SPME) on-fiber derivatization methods have facilitated the achievement of lower detection limits and targeted analysis of various substances that exhibit poor chromatographic behavior, thermal instability, or high reactivity while limiting the use of organic solvents. However, previously developed on-fiber derivatization methods have been hindered by poor loading reproducibility and standard lifetime due to derivatization reagent reactivity. In addition, this reactivity often results in these reagents demonstrating toxic effects, complicating handling and standard formulation. To address this, a reusable standard gas generating vial containing pentafluorophenyl hydrazine (PFPH) has been developed. With this development, SPME fibers can now be reproducibly loaded with derivatization reagent, from an easy to use and safe platform. Validation of the vial using C4–C9 linear aldehyde standards as target analytes demonstrated intrabatch vial reproducibility (2\% relative standard deviation (RSD), n = 4), along with PFPH headspace stability over a period of 11 weeks, facilitating reduced reagent consumption due to standard longevity. In addition, reproducibility of the derivatization reaction was observed over 1 week (RSD {\textless} 9\%), and the linear concentration range was evaluated using headspace extractions from aqueous aldehyde solutions (R2 {\textgreater} 0.996, 10–200 ppb v/v). Finally, the PFPH-generating vial was applied to the monitoring of volatile aldehydes generated during meat spoilage, as well as an on-site application where the free and total concentration of formaldehyde was determined in car exhaust using a portable GC/MS. To the best of our knowledge, the standard gas generating vial proposed in this work is the first documented device for the long-term storage of reusable headspace standards for a reactive, toxic, and otherwise unstable derivatization reagent standard.},

	abstract = {In this paper problems associated with preparation of aqueous standard of highly hydrophobic compounds such as partial precipitation, being lost on the surfaces, low solubility in water and limited sample volume for accurate determination of their distribution coefficients are addressed. The following work presents two approaches that utilize blade thin film microextraction (TFME) to investigate partitioning of UV filters and biocides to humic acid (dissolved organic carbon) and sediment. A steady-state concentration of target analytes in water was generated using a flow-through aqueous standard generation (ASG) system. Dialysis membranes, a polytetrafluoroethylene permeation tube, and a frit porous (0.5 μm) coated by epoxy glue were basic elements used for preparation of the ASG system. In the currently presented study, negligible depletion TFME using hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) and octadecyl silica-based (C18) sorbents was employed towards the attainment of free concentration values of target analytes in the studied matrices. Thin film geometry provided a large volume of extraction phase, which improved the sensitivity of the method towards highly matrix-bound analytes. Extractions were performed in the equilibrium regime so as to prevent matrix effects and with aims to reach maximum method sensitivity for all analytes under study. Partitioning of analytes on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was investigated in ASG to facilitate large sample volume conditions. Binding percentages and DOC distribution coefficients (Log KDOC) ranged from 20 to 98\% and 3.71–6.72, respectively. Furthermore, sediment-water partition coefficients (Kd), organic-carbon normalized partition coefficients (Log KOC), and DOC distribution coefficients (Log KDOC) were investigated in slurry sediment, and ranged from 33 to 2860, 3.31–5.24 and 4.52–5.75 Lkg-1, respectively. The obtained results demonstrated that investigations utilizing ASG and TFME can yield reliable binding information for compounds with high log KOW values. This information is useful for study of fate, transport, and ecotoxicological effects of UV filters and biocides in aquatic environment.},

Very short sampling times from 5 s to 1 min were used to minimize the effects of competitive adsorption and to calibrate the extraction process in the initial linear extraction region. The predicted amounts of extracted mass compared well with the measured amounts of target VOCs. Findings presented in this study extend the existing fundamental knowledge related to sampling/sample preparation with SPME, thereby enabling the development of new sampling devices for the rapid sampling of air, headspace, water, and soil.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a well-known sampling and sample preparation technique used for a wide variety of analytical applications. As there are various complex processes taking place at the time of extraction that influence the parameters of optimum extraction, a mathematical model and computational simulation describing the SPME process is required for experimentalists to understand and implement the technique without performing multiple costly and time-consuming experiments in the laboratory. In this study, a mechanistic mathematical model for the processes occurring in SPME extraction of analyte(s) from an aqueous sample medium is presented. The proposed mechanistic model was validated with previously reported experimental data from three different sources. Several key factors that affect the extraction kinetics, such as sample agitation, fiber coating thickness, and presence of a binding matrix component, are discussed. More interestingly, for the first time, shorter or longer equilibrium times in the presence of a binding matrix component were explained with the help of an asymptotic analysis. Parameters that contribute to the variation of the equilibrium times are discussed, with the assumption that one binding matrix component is present in a static sample. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model captures the phenomena occurring in SPME, leading to a clearer understanding of this process. Therefore, the currently presented model can be used to identify optimum experimental parameters without the need to perform a large number of experiments in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {Despite the benefits of diffusion-based calibrant-free sampling based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME), this quantification approach is often underestimated due to an inadequate understanding of how extraction parameters influence the extracted amount and quantification of analytes. Currently, application of this approach for complex samples with binding matrix components is very limited. This study presents the development of a computational model that is used to identify the critical parameters for the diffusion-based sampling. Simulations are conducted under simultaneous variations in mass transfer and adsorptive surface binding constants and the presence of a binding matrix component in the sample. The simulation results correlate well with previously reported experimental data and improve the predictions when compared to previously introduced semiempirical models. This work enhanced basic understanding of physical processes involved in analyte quantification with SPME, which is of benefit when performing experimental designs, particularly where traditional calibration methods are not suitable.},

	abstract = {A new SPME method for untargeted lipidomic study of cell line cultures was proposed for the first time. In this study the feasibility to monitor changes in lipid profile after external stimuli was demonstrated and compared to the conventional Bligh \& Dyer method. The human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line was used as a model. The obtained results provided a list of up-regulated and down-regulated lipids through a comparison between control (non-stimulated) cells versus the group of cells treated with polyunsaturated fatty acid (20:5). Use of the SPME technique yielded a list of 77 lipid species whose concentrations were recognized to be significantly different between control and treated cells, from which 63 lipids were up-regulated in treated cells. In general, the list was comparable to the peer list obtained by the Bligh \& Dyer method. However, more diversity of lipid classes and subclasses such as LPC, sphingomyelins, ceramides, and prenol lipids were observed with the application of the SPME method. Method precision for the SPME approach was within the acceptable analytical range (5–18\% RSD) for all detected lipids, which was advantageous over solvent extraction applied. The evaluation of ionization efficiency indicated no matrix effect for the SPME technique, while Bligh \& Dyer presented significant ionization suppression for low abundant species such as LysoPC, PG, ceramides, and sphingomyelins, and ionization enhancement for high abundant phospholipids such as PE.},

Relative standard deviations were {\textless}30\% for phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene implying excellent reproducibility of K(PEw) across laboratories and PE sources. Averaged K(PEw) values of various HOCs were best correlated with aqueous solubility, logC(w)(sat)(L): logK(PEw) = -0.99(+/-0.029)logC(w)(sat)(L) + 2.39(+/-0.096) (r(2) = 0.92, SE = 0.35, n = 100). For 80\% of analytes, this equation predicted logK(PEw) within a factor of 2. A first-order estimation of K(PEw) can be obtained assuming constant solubility of the compounds in the PE, such that the variation in C(w)(sat)(L) determines the differences in K(PEw). For PE samplers, K(PEw) values do not change with the thickness of the PE sampler. The influence of temperature on K(PEw) seems dominated by solubility-changes of the compound in water, not in PE. The effect of salt is rather well understood, using a Schetschenow-style approach. The air-PE partitioning constant, K(PEa), can be approximated as the ratio of K(PEw)/K(aw) (the air-water partitioning constant). A critical review of diffusivities in PE, D(PE), suggests that best results are obtained when using the film-stacking method. A good correlation is then found between D(PE) and molar volume, V(m) (A(3)/mol): logD(PE) (m(2)/s) = 0.0145(+/-0.001)V(m) + 10.1(+/-0.20) (r(2) = 0.76, SE = 0.24, n = 74).},

The carbonized electrospun nanofiber-coated SPME fibers showed no swelling when immersed in a variety of liquids, demonstrating the improved chemical stability these coatings have over traditional polymer-coated SPME fibers, which typically swell during direct extraction. Additionally, these robust coatings exhibit prolonged fiber lifetimes, withstanding up to 100 direct extractions without significant damage or change in nanofiber morphology.

	abstract = {This study examines the effect of dissolved humic substances (DHS) on the rate of water-gas exchange of organic compounds under conditions where diffusion through the aqueous boundary layer is rate-determining. A synthetic surfactant was applied for comparison. Mass-transfer coefficients were determined from the rate of depletion of the model compounds by means of an apparatus containing a stirred aqueous solution with continuous purging of the headspace above the solution. In addition, experiments with continuous passive dosing of analytes into the water phase were conducted to simulate a system where thermodynamic activity of the chemical in the aqueous phase is identical in the presence and absence of DHS. The experimental results show that DHS and surfactants can affect water-gas exchange rates by the superposition of two mechanisms: (1) hydrodynamic effects due to surface film formation ("surface smoothing"), and (2) sorption-induced effects. Whether sorption accelerates or retards mass transfer depends on its effect on the thermodynamic activity of the pollutant in the aqueous phase. Mass transfer will be retarded if the activity (or freely dissolved concentration) of the pollutant is decreased due to sorption. If it remains unchanged (e.g., due to fast equilibration with a sediment acting as a large source phase), then DHS and surfactant micelles can act as an additional shuttle for the pollutants, enhancing the flux through the boundary layer.},

Alongside the silver nanoparticles benefits, their novel properties have raised concerns about possible adverse effects on biological systems. To protect consumer's health and the environment, efficient monitoring of silver nanoparticles needs to be established. Here, we present the development of human metallothionein (MT) based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor for rapid detection of nanosilver. Incorporation of human metallothionein 1A to the sensor surface enables screening for potentially biologically active silver nanoparticles at parts per billion sensitivity. Other protein ligands were also tested for binding capacity of the nanosilver and were found to be inferior to the metallothionein. The biosensor has been characterized in terms of selectivity and sensitivity towards different types of silver nanoparticles and applied in measurements of real-life samples-such as fresh vegetables and river water. Our findings suggest that human MT1-based SPR sensor has the potential to be utilized as a routine screening method for silver nanoparticles, that can provide rapid and automated analysis dedicated to environmental and food safety monitoring.},

Herein, we investigate the influence of 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.4)/0.1 M NaCl/10 mM CaCl(2)/0.1\% Tween-20 used as assay buffer and diluent for serum, plasma and saliva samples in a protein biomarker chip for the diagnosis of sepsis. In detail, on-chip sandwich assays for detection of IL-6 and PCT are established using pure assay buffer and serum, plasma, and saliva, each diluted by a factor of 10 and 100 with assay buffer. The dilution linearity as well as the cross-reactivity to immobilized IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha antibodies ({\textless}1.8\% in plasma and serum) is investigated; furthermore the influence of immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen and lysozyme, highly abundant proteins in serum, plasma and saliva. This effect is two times more pronounced in serum than in plasma and saliva and strongly decreases with increasing analyte concentration. Though the matrix proteins bind unspecifically to the immobilized receptors, they do not prevent the analyte binding; on the contrary, the analyte is reliably detected with high sensitivity, featuring limits of detection of 16 ng/L and 0.31 mug/L, and coefficients of variation of 18\% and 29\% for IL-6 and PCT in 10\% serum.},

Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) methods have been developed, offering quick, undemanding, noninvasive sampling without the use of solvents. In this study, time-weighted average SPME (TWA-SPME) sampling was evaluated for in planta quantification of chlorinated solvents. TWA-SPME was found to have increased sensitivity over headspace and equilibrium SPME sampling. Using a variety of chlorinated solvents and a polydimethylsiloxane/carboxen (PDMS/CAR) SPME fiber, most compounds exhibited near linear or linear uptake over the sampling period. Smaller, less hydrophobic compounds exhibited more nonlinearity than larger, more hydrophobic molecules. Using a specifically designed in planta sampler, field sampling was conducted at a site contaminated with chlorinated solvents. Sampling with TWA-SPME produced instrument responses ranging from 5 to over 200 times higher than headspace tree core sampling. This work demonstrates that TWA-SPME can be used for in planta detection of a broad range of chlorinated solvents and methods can likely be applied to other volatile and semivolatile organic compounds.},

Ideally, in silico simulations can quantitatively predict the impact of formulation and processing parameters on the resulting drug release kinetics. The aim of this article is to give an overview on the current state of the art of modeling drug release from delivery systems, which are predominantly controlled by diffusional mass transport. The inner structure of the device, the ratio "initial drug concentration:drug solubility" as well as the device geometry determine which type of mathematical equation must be applied. A straightforward "road map" is given, explaining how to identify the appropriate equation for a particular type of drug delivery system. The respective equations for a broad range of devices are indicated, including reservoir and matrix systems, exhibiting or not an initial excess of drug and the geometry of slabs, spheres and cylinders. The assumptions the models are based on as well as their limitations are pointed out. Practical examples illustrate the usefulness of mathematical modeling of diffusion controlled drug delivery. Due to the advances in information technology the importance of in silico optimization of advanced drug delivery systems can be expected to significantly increase in the future.},

	abstract = {This study aims to use solid phase microextraction (SPME), a simple tool to investigate diffusion rate (time) constant of selected pharmaceuticals in gel and fish muscle by comparing desorption rate of diffusion of the drugs in both agarose gel prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and fish muscle. The gel concentration (agarose gel model) that could be used to simulate tissue matrix (fish muscle) for free diffusion of drugs under in vitro and in vivo conditions was determined to model mass transfer phenomena between fibre polymer coating and environmental matrix such that partition coefficients and desorption time constant (diffusion coefficient) can be determined. SPME procedure involves preloading the extraction phase (fibre) with the standards from spiked PBS for 1h via direct extraction. Subsequently, the preloaded fibre is introduced to the sample such fish or agarose gel for specified time ranging from 0.5 to 60 h. Then, fibre is removed at specified time and desorbed in 100 muL of desorption solution (acetonitrile: water 1:1) for 90 min under agitation speed of 1000 rpm. The samples extract were immediately injected to the instrument and analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The limit of detection of the method in gel and fish muscle was 0.01-0.07 ng mL(-1) and 0.07-0.34 ng g(-1), respectively, while the limit quantification was 0.10-0.20 ng mL(-1) in gel samples and 0.40-0.97 ng g(-1) in fish sample. The reproducibility of the method was good (5-15\% RSD). The results suggest that kinetics of desorption of the compounds in fish tissue and different viscosity of gel can be determined using desorption time constant. In this study, desorption time constant which is directly related to desorption rate (diffusion kinetics) of selected drugs from the fibre to the gel matrix is faster as the viscosity of the gel matrix reduces from 2\% (w/v) to 0.8\% (w/v). As the concentration of gel reduces, viscosity of the gel will be reduced therefore allowing faster diffusion which invariably affect desorption time constant. Also, desorption time constant of model drugs in the fish muscle and 0.8-0.9\% (w/v) gel model are similar based on free diffusion of studied compounds. In addition, in vitro and in vivo desorption time constant comparison shows that desorption time constant in an in vivo system (live fish muscle) is generally higher than an in vitro system (dead fish muscle) except for sertraline and nordiazepam. This study demonstrates SPME as a simple investigative tool to understand kinetics of desorption in an in vivo system with a goal to measure desorption rate of pharmaceuticals in fish.},

	abstract = {Here, we describe a sensitive and specific method for thrombin detection with aptamer functionalized core-shell Fe(3)O(4)@C@Au magnetic microspheres (Au-MMPs). Firstly, Au-MMPs were synthesized through surface adsorption of gold nanoparticles onto PDDA functionalized Fe(3)O(4)@C magnetic microspheres. Then, the as-synthesized Au-MMPs were developed as new substrate for immobilization of thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) through easy formation of Au-S bond. After that, the prepared aptamer functionalized Au-MMPs (TBA@Au-MMPs) were used as effective magnetic absorbent to extract trace level of thrombin from dilute solutions. Finally, enriched thrombin was digested by trypsin and analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Taking advantage of the efficient affinity extraction ability of our TBA@Au-MMPs and the sensitive mass readout of MALDI-TOF, highly sensitive detection of thrombin was achieved. The limit of detection was as low as 18 fmol, corresponding to 0.36 nM thrombin in 50 muL original solution. Linear relation was observed within a concentration range from 0.5 nM to 10nM with linear correlation R(2)=0.998. Other proteins including human serum albumin (HSA), Ig G, transferrin, oval albumin (OVA) and fetal calf serum did not interfere with thrombin detection. This simple method holds great potential for analyzing, sensing, purification and preconcentration of proteins in biological fluids.},

The model (PAS-SIM) simulates the transport of the chemical across the air-side boundary layer and within the sampler medium, which is segmented into a user-defined number of thin layers. Model performance was evaluated using data for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a field calibration study (i.e., active and XAD-PAS data) conducted in Egbert, Ontario, Canada. With some exceptions, modeled PAS uptake curves are in good agreement with the empirical PAS data. The results are highly encouraging, given the uncertainty in the active air sampler data used as input and other uncertainties related to model parametrization (e.g., sampler-air partition coefficients, the influence of wind speed on sampling rates). The study supports the further development and evaluation of the PAS-SIM model as a diagnostic (e.g., to aid interpretation of calibration studies and monitoring data) and prognostic (e.g., to inform design of future passive air sampling campaigns) tool.},

We performed qualitative and semi-quantitative comparisons of the performances of passive SBSE firstly to automated sampling coupled to analytical SBSE, and secondly to the polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), a well-known passive sampler for hydrophilic micropollutants. Applying passive SBSE in river waters allowed the quantification of more pesticides and in greater amounts than analytical SBSE as shown for samples collected concurrently. Also, passive SBSE and POCIS proved to be complementary techniques in terms of detected molecules; but only passive SBSE was able to integrate a concentration peak triggered by a quick flood event that lasted 5 h. Passive SBSE could be an interesting tool for the monitoring of moderately hydrophobic to hydrophobic organic micropollutants in changing hydrosystems. In this purpose, further studies will focus on the accumulation kinetics of target pesticides and the determination of their sampling rates.},

	abstract = {Micropollutant monitoring in stormwater discharges is challenging because of the diversity of sources and thus large number of pollutants found in stormwater. This is further complicated by the dynamics in runoff flows and the large number of discharge points. Most passive samplers are nonideal for sampling such systems because they sample in a time-integrative manner. This paper reports test of a flow-through passive sampler, deployed in stormwater runoff at the outlet of a residential-industrial catchment. Momentum from the water velocity during runoff events created flow through the sampler resulting in velocity dependent sampling. This approach enables the integrative sampling of stormwater runoff during periods of weeks to months while weighting actual runoff events higher than no flow periods. Results were comparable to results from volume-proportional samples and results obtained from using a dynamic stormwater quality model (DSQM). The paper illustrates how velocity-dependent flow-through passive sampling may revolutionize the way stormwater discharges are monitored. It also opens the possibility to monitor a larger range of discharge sites over longer time periods instead of focusing on single sites and single events, and it shows how this may be combined with DSQMs to interpret results and estimate loads over extended time periods.},

However, conventional SPME sampling requires the attainment of equilibrium between the fiber and sample matrix, which may take weeks or months, greatly limiting its applicability. In this study, we explored the preloading of polydimethylsiloxane fiber with stable isotope labeled analogs (SI-SPME) to circumvent the need for long sampling time, and evaluated the performance of SI-SPME against the conventional equilibrium SPME (Eq-SPME) using a range of sediments and conditions. Desorption of stable isotope-labeled analogs and absorption of PCB-52, PCB-153, bifenthrin and cis-permethrin were isotropic, validating the assumption for SI-SPME. Highly reproducible preloading was achieved using acetone-water (1:4, v/v) as the carrier. Compared to Eq-SPME that required weeks or even months, the fiber concentrations (Cf) under equilibrium could be reliably estimated by SI-SPME in 1 day under agitated conditions or 20 days under static conditions in spiked sediments. The Cf values predicted by SI-SPME were statistically identical to those determined by Eq-SPME. The SI-SPME method was further applied successfully to field sediments contaminated with PCB 52, PCB 153, and bifenthrin. The increasing availability of stable isotope labeled standards and mass spectrometry nowadays makes SI-SPME highly feasible, allowing the use of SPME under nonequilibrium conditions with much shorter or flexible sampling time.},

	abstract = {Air sampling based on diffusion of target molecules from the atmospheric gas phase to passive sampling media (PSMs) is currently modeled using the two-film approach. Originally developed to describe chemical exchange between air and water, it assumes a uniform chemical distribution in the bulk phases on either side of the interfacial films. Although such an assumption may be satisfied when modeling uptake in PSMs in which chemicals have high mobility, its validity is questionable for PSMs such as polyurethane foam disks and XAD-resin packed mesh cylinders. Mass transfer of chemicals through the PSMs may be subject to a large resistance because of the low mass fraction of gas-phase chemicals in the pores, where diffusion occurs. Here we present a model that does not assume that chemicals distribute uniformly in the PSMs. It describes the sequential diffusion of vapors through a stagnant air-side boundary layer and the PSM pores, and the reversible sorption onto the PSM. Sensitivity analyses reveal the potential influence of the latter two processes on passive sampling rates (PSRs) unless the air-side boundary layer is assumed to be extremely thick (i.e., representative of negligible wind speeds). The model also reveals that the temperature dependence of PSRs, differences in PSRs between different compounds, and a two-stage uptake, all observed in field calibrations, can be attributed to those mass transfer processes within the PSM. The kinetics of chemical sorption to the PSM from the gas phase in the macro-pores is a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed before the model can be applied to specific compounds.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the desorption behavior of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from marine plastic pellets. Long-term desorption experiments were conducted using field-collected polyethylene (PE) pellets. The results indicate that the desorption kinetics highly depends on the PE-water partition coefficients of PCB congeners. After 128 d of the experiment, the smallest congener considered (CB 8) had desorbed nearly completely (98\%), whereas major fractions (90-99\%) of highly chlorinated congeners remained in the pellets. An intraparticle diffusion model mostly failed to reproduce the desorption kinetics, whereas an aqueous boundary layer (ABL) diffusion model well approximated the data. The desorption half-lives are estimated to 14 d to 210 years for CB 8 to CB 209 in an actively stirred solution (ABL thickness: 30 mum). Addition of methanol to water enhanced the desorption to a large extent. A need for further work to explore roles of organic matter in facilitating solute transfer is suggested.},

The nanoporous membrane not only acts as platform for the thrombin recognition but also as filter of the micrometric components such as white and red blood cells, consequently minimizing matrix effects. The protocol involves a sandwich format in the inner walls (200 nm diameter) of an anodized alumina oxide filter membrane (AAO). The analytical signal, by DPV oxidation of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-), is based on the blockage in the pores which affects the diffusion of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-) to the screen-printed carbon electrotransducer (SPCEs) modified with the membrane. By labeling the anti-thrombin IgG with AuNPs followed by silver enhancement a greater passive signal enhancement in comparison to the membrane blockage has been observed. The contribution of both electrostatic/steric effects in this blockage due to the subsequent formation of the aptamer-thrombin complex and the final sandwich assay is investigated. The efficiency of the system is also monitored by microscopic techniques. The resulted biosensing system allows detecting thrombin spiked in whole blood at very low levels (LOD 1.8 ng mL(-1)) which are within the range of clinical interest for the diagnostic of coagulation abnormalities as well as pulmonary metastasis.},

The purpose of this study was to calibrate and evaluate an existing, polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymeric resin-based passive air sampler (XAD-PAS) for VMS. Sixteen XAD-PAS were deployed for 7-98 days at a suburban site in Toronto, Canada, while the VMS concentration in air was monitored by an active sampling method. This calibration and a subsequent field test further allowed for investigation of the temporal and spatial variability of VMS in the region. Uptake in the XAD-PAS of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), and three linear VMS was linear throughout the whole deployment period. Sampling rates were between 0.4 and 0.5 m(3)/day. The XAD-PAS measured summation operatorVMS concentrations ranged from nondetects in rural areas (n = 3), to 169 +/- 49 ng/m(3) in the urban region (n = 21), to levels above 600 ng/m(3) at sewage treatment plants (n = 2). Levels and composition of VMS within the urban area were remarkably uniform in space. Levels, but not composition, were highly variable in time and weakly correlated with temperature, wind speed, and wind direction.},

	abstract = {Conventional solid phase microextraction (SPME) has a limited capacity to extract very polar analytes, such as adenosine. To solve this problem, aptamer conjugating sol-gel methodology was coupled with an SPME fiber. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported use of aptamer SPME. The fiber of aptamer sol-gel SPME with a mesoporous structure has high porosity, large surface area, and small water contact angle. Rather than employing direct entrapment, covalent immobilization was the dominant method of aptamer loading in sol-gel. Aptamer sol-gel fiber captured a specified analyte from among the analog molecules, thereby, exhibiting an excellent selective property. Compared with commercial SPME fibers, this aptamer fiber was suitable for extracting adenosine, presenting an extraction efficiency higher than 20-fold. The values of repeatability and reproducibility expressed by relative standard deviation were low (9.4\%). Interestingly, the sol-gel network enhanced the resistance of aptamer SPME to both nuclease and nonspecific proteins. Furthermore, the aptamer sol-gel fiber was applied in human plasma with LOQ 1.5 mug/L, which is an acceptable level.

	abstract = {We studied the sorption of amphetamine as a model drug to represent small, polar organic cations to a new SPME coating combining C18 and propylsulfonic acid. This combination of hydrophobic and strong cation exchange (SCX) groups was compared to conventional SPME fibers with polyacrylate (PA) or C18 coating. The affinity of amphetamine at physiological pH (PBS) was 20 to 180 times greater for the new C18/SCX coating than for C18 alone and PA of different coating thickness. As amphetamine is a base and {\textgreater}99\% protonated at physiological pH, this enhanced affinity is attributed to the ion-exchange phase in the coating. Tests at pH above the pKa of amphetamine show that, when normalized to the coating volume, neutral amphetamine also has a higher affinity compared to PA. As ion-exchange groups are not unlimitedly present in the coating, amphetamine isotherms level off to a saturation concentration on the C18/SCX fiber at the highest tested aqueous concentrations. Also, other cations (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+)) compete for the SCX sites and decrease the sorption coefficients, e.g. by 1.7 log units when comparing Milli-Q water with PBS. The C18/SCX fiber provides improved sensitivity over some of the classic SPME fibers. However, care should be taken near the cation exchange capacity of the fiber and the fiber should be calibrated in an appropriate matrix so as to eliminate competition effects.},

Recently, passive sampling devices have been utilized to estimate dissolved concentrations of contaminants of concern (COCs), such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In the present study, the performance of 3 common passive samplers was evaluated for sampling PAHs and PCBs at several stations in the temperate estuary Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. Sampler polymers included polyethylene (PE), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers, and polyoxymethylene (POM). Dissolved concentrations of each contaminant were calculated using measured sampler concentrations adjusted for equilibrium conditions with performance reference compounds (PRCs) and chemical-specific partition coefficients derived in the laboratory. Despite differences in PE and POM sampler concentrations, calculated total dissolved concentrations ranged from 14 ng/L to 93 ng/L and from 13 pg/L to 465 pg/L for PAHs and PCBs, respectively. Dissolved concentrations of PAHs were approximately 3 times greater based on POM compared to PE, while dissolved concentrations of PCBs based on PE were approximately 3 times greater than those based on POM. Concentrations in SPME were not reported due to the lack of detectable chemical in the amount of PDMS polymer deployed. Continued research is needed to improve and support PE and POM use for the routine monitoring of COCs. For example, a better understanding of the use of PRCs with POM is critically needed.},

	abstract = {Passive air samplers (PAS) including polyurethane foam (PUF) are widely deployed as an inexpensive and practical way to sample semivolatile pollutants. However, concentration estimates from PAS rely on constant empirical mass transfer rates, which add unquantified uncertainties to concentrations. Here we present a method for modeling hourly sampling rates for semivolatile compounds from hourly meteorology using first-principle chemistry, physics, and fluid dynamics, calibrated from depuration experiments. This approach quantifies and explains observed effects of meteorology on variability in compound-specific sampling rates and analyte concentrations, simulates nonlinear PUF uptake, and recovers synthetic hourly concentrations at a reference temperature. Sampling rates are evaluated for polychlorinated biphenyl congeners at a network of Harner model samplers in Chicago, IL, during 2008, finding simulated average sampling rates within analytical uncertainty of those determined from loss of depuration compounds and confirming quasilinear uptake. Results indicate hourly, daily, and interannual variability in sampling rates, sensitivity to temporal resolution in meteorology, and predictable volatility-based relationships between congeners. We quantify the importance of each simulated process to sampling rates and mass transfer and assess uncertainty contributed by advection, molecular diffusion, volatilization, and flow regime within the PAS, finding that PAS chamber temperature contributes the greatest variability to total process uncertainty (7.3\%).},

Inter alia, the role of mathematical modeling and computer-assisted device design is briefly addressed in the Position Paper. This emerging and particularly promising field is considered in more depth in this commentary. In fact, in-silico simulations have become of fundamental importance in numerous scientific and related domains, allowing for a better understanding of various phenomena and for facilitated device design. The development of novel prototypes of space shuttles, nuclear power plants and automobiles are just a few examples. In-silico simulations are nowadays also well established in the field of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and have become an integral part of the discovery and development process of novel drug products. Since Takeru Higuchi published his seminal equation in 1961 the use of mathematical models for the analysis and optimization of drug delivery systems in vitro has also become more and more popular. However, applying in-silico simulations for facilitated optimization of advanced drug delivery systems is not yet common practice. One of the reasons is the gap between in vitro and in vivo (PK/PD) simulations. In the future it can be expected that this gap will be closed and that computer assisted device design will play a central role in the research on, and development of advanced drug delivery systems.},

Uptake kinetics need to be quantified to calculate time-weighted average concentrations from Chemcatcher field deployments. Information on release kinetics is needed if performance reference compounds (PRCs) are used to quantify the influence of environmental conditions on the uptake. In a series of uptake and elimination experiments, we used Empore SDB disks (poly(styrenedivinylbenzene) copolymer modified with sulfonic acid groups) as a sampling phase and 22 compounds with a logK(ow) (octanol-water partitioning coefficient) range from -2.6 to 3.8. Uptake experiments were conducted in river water or tap water and lasted up to 25 days. Only 1 of 22 compounds (sulfamethoxazole) approached equilibrium in the uptake trials. Other compounds showed continuing non-linear uptake, even after 25 days. All compounds could be released from SDB disks, and desorption was proportionally higher in disks loaded for shorter periods. Desorption showed two-phase characteristics, and desorption was proportionally higher for passively sorbed compounds compared to actively loaded compounds (active loading was performed by pulling spiked river water over SDB disks using vacuum). We hypothesise that the two-phase kinetics and better retention of actively loaded compounds--and compounds loaded for a longer period--may be caused by slow diffusion of chemicals within the polymer. As sorption and desorption did not show isotropic kinetics, it is not possible to develop robust PRCs for adsorbent material like SDB disks.},

In this work the information about novel methodological and instrumental solutions in relation to different variants of solid phase extraction techniques, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) is presented, including practical applications of these techniques and a critical discussion about their advantages and disadvantages. The proposed solutions fulfill the requirements resulting from the concept of sustainable development, and specifically from the implementation of green chemistry principles in analytical laboratories. Therefore, particular attention was paid to the description of possible uses of novel, selective stationary phases in extraction techniques, inter alia, polymeric ionic liquids, carbon nanotubes, and silica- and carbon-based sorbents. The methodological solutions, together with properly matched sampling devices for collecting analytes from samples with varying matrix composition, enable us to reduce the number of errors during the sample preparation prior to chromatographic analysis as well as to limit the negative impact of this analytical step on the natural environment and the health of laboratory employees.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to further validate the use of ultrafiltration (UF) as a method for determining plasma protein binding (PPB) by demonstrating that non-specific binding (NSB) is not a limitation, even for highly lipophilic compounds, because NSB sites on the apparatus are passivated in the presence of plasma. Mass balance theory was used to calculate recovery of 20 commercial and seven investigational compounds during ultrafiltration in the presence and absence of plasma. PPB was also measured using this mass balance approach for comparison to PPB determined by rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) and as found in the literature. Compound recovery during UF was dramatically different in the presence and absence of plasma for compounds with high NSB in PBS only. A comparison of PPB calculated by ultrafiltration with literature values or calculated by RED gave concordant results. Discrepancies could be explained by changes in pH, insufficient time to equilibrium, or compound instability during RED, problems which were circumvented by ultrafiltration. Therefore, NSB, as measured by the traditional incubation of compound in PBS, need not be an issue when choosing UF as a PPB assay method. It is more appropriate to calculate compound recovery from the device in plasma as measured by mass balance to determine the suitability of the method for an individual compound. The speed with which UF can be conducted additionally avoids changes in pH or compound loss that can occur with other methods. The mass balance approach to UF is thus a preferred method for rapid determination of PPB.},

We studied release kinetics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from fresh and aged tar phases using a dialysis tubing technique. Time for equilibration ranged from several days to more than three years. For fresh tar materials the release seems to be limited by retarded pore diffusion, while for two of three aged tars diffusion limited release influenced by dissolved organic matter (DOM) was assumed. The equilibration process was driven by solubilization thermodynamics expressed by Raoult's law. Yet, solubility enhancement was observed potentially due to the presence of organic mobile sorbents. The results show that the release of PAHs from tar phases is generally rate limited and partitioning according to Raoult's law is the driving mechanism of the exchanges process.},

	abstract = {Time-weighted average (TWA) passive sampling using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography was investigated as a new method of collecting, identifying and quantifying contaminants in process gas streams. Unlike previous TWA-SPME techniques using the retracted fiber configuration (fiber within needle) to monitor ambient conditions or relatively stagnant gases, this method was developed for fast-moving process gas streams at temperatures approaching 300 degrees C. The goal was to develop a consistent and reliable method of analyzing low concentrations of contaminants in hot gas streams without performing time-consuming exhaustive extraction with a slipstream. This work in particular aims to quantify trace tar compounds found in a syngas stream generated from biomass gasification. This paper evaluates the concept of retracted SPME at high temperatures by testing the three essential requirements for TWA passive sampling: (1) zero-sink assumption, (2) consistent and reliable response by the sampling device to changing concentrations, and (3) equal concentrations in the bulk gas stream relative to the face of the fiber syringe opening. Results indicated the method can accurately predict gas stream concentrations at elevated temperatures. Evidence was also discovered to validate the existence of a second boundary layer within the fiber during the adsorption/absorption process. This limits the technique to operating within reasonable mass loadings and loading rates, established by appropriate sampling depths and times for concentrations of interest. A limit of quantification for the benzene model tar system was estimated at 0.02 g m(-3) (8 ppm) with a limit of detection of 0.5 mg m(-3) (200 ppb). Using the appropriate conditions, the technique was applied to a pilot-scale fluidized-bed gasifier to verify its feasibility. Results from this test were in good agreement with literature and prior pilot plant operation, indicating the new method can measure low concentrations of tar in gasification streams.},

	abstract = {The bioavailability and ecological risk of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in aquatic environments largely depends on their freely dissolved concentrations. In this work, the freely dissolved concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including phenanthrene, pyrene, and chrysene were determined for the Yellow River, Haihe River and Yongding River of China using polyethylene devices (PEDs). The results indicated that the order of ratios of freely to total dissolved concentrations of the three PAHs was phenanthrene (66.8+/-20.1\%){\textgreater}pyrene (48.8+/-26.4\%){\textgreater}chrysene (5.5+/-3.3\%) for the three rivers. The ratios were significantly negatively correlated with the logK(ow) values of the PAHs. In addition, the ratios were negatively correlated with the suspended sediment (SPS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the river water, and the characteristics of the SPS and DOC were also important factors. Simulation experiments showed that the ratio of freely to total dissolved concentrations of pyrene in the aqueous phase decreased with increasing SPS concentration; when the sediment concentration increased from 2 g L(-1) to 10 g L(-1), the ratio decreased from 67.6\% to 38.4\% for Yellow River sediment and decreased from 50.4\% to 33.6\% for Haihe River sediment. This was because with increasing SPS concentration, more and more DOC, small particles and colloids ({\textless}0.45 mum) would enter the aqueous phase. Because high SPS and DOC concentrations exist in many rivers, their effect on the freely dissolved concentrations of HOCs should be considered when conducting an ecological risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Passive air samplers (PASs) operate in different types of environment under various wind conditions, which may affect sampling rates and thus introduce uncertainty to PAS-derived air concentrations. To quantify the effect of wind speed and angle on the uptake in cylindrical PASs using XAD-resin as the sampling medium, we measured the uptake kinetics of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in XAD and of water in silica-gel, both under quasi wind-still condition and with lab-generated wind blowing toward the PASs at various speeds and angles. Passive sampling rates (PSRs) of PCBs under laboratory generated windy conditions were approximately 3-4 times higher than under wind-still indoor conditions. The rate of water uptake by silica-gel increased with wind speed, following a logarithmic function so that PSRs are more strongly influenced at lower wind speed. PSRs of both PCBs and water varied little with wind angle, which is consistent with computational fluid dynamic simulations showing that different angles of wind incidence cause only minor variations of air velocities within the cylindrical sampler housing. Because modifications of the design of the cylindrical PAS were not successful in eliminating the wind speed dependence of PSRs at low wind levels, indoor and outdoor deployments require different sets of PSRs. The effect of wind speed and angle on the PSRs of the cylindrical PAS are much smaller than what has been reported for the double-bowl polyurethane foam PAS. PSRs of the cylindrical XAD-PAS therefore tend to vary much less between sampling sites exposed to different wind conditions.},

	abstract = {A novel alumina nanowire (ANW) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber coating was prepared by a simple and rapid anodization-chemical etching method for ultra-selective determination of volatile esters and alcohols from complicated food samples. Preparation conditions for ANW SPME fiber coating including corrosion solution concentration and corrosion time were optimized in detail for better surface morphology and higher surface area based on scanning electron microscope (SEM). Under the optimum conditions, homogeneous alumina nanowire structure of ANW SPME fiber coating was achieved with the average thickness of 20 mum around. Compared with most of commercial SPME fiber coatings, ANW SPME fiber coatings achieved the higher extraction capacity and special selectivity for volatile esters and alcohols. Finally, an efficient gas sampling technique based on ANW SPME fiber coating as the core was established and successfully applied for the ultra-selective determination of trace volatile esters and alcohols from complicated banana and fermented glutinous rice samples coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) detection. It was interesting that 25 esters and 2 alcohols among 30 banana volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified and 4 esters and 7 alcohols among 13 identified VOCs of fermented glutinous rice were selectively sampled by ANW SPME fiber coatings. Furthermore, new analytical methods for the determination of some typical volatile esters and alcohols from banana and fermented glutinous rice samples at specific storage or brewing phases were developed and validated. Good recoveries for banana and fermented glutinous rice samples were achieved in range of 108-115\% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.6-6.7\% and 80.0-91.8\% with RSDs of 0.3-1.3\% (n=3), respectively. This work proposed a novel and efficient gas sampling technique of ANW SPME which was quite suitable for ultra-selectively sampling trace volatile esters and alcohols from complicated food samples.},

Due to this buildup of HOCs in the sediment, the highest water concentrations are often in the pore water. Passive samplers can be used in the field (i.e., in situ) to measure freely dissolved porewater concentrations if target contaminants diffusing through the sediment and into the sampler exhibit the same diffusive retardation factors as performance reference compounds (PRCs) that are diffusing out of the sampler and into the sediment. To test this assumption, polyethylene (PE) passive samplers were placed in an organic- and black- carbon-rich sediment bed in the laboratory with samplers removed every 30 days for 4 months. The concentrations of target contaminants in the PE at each time point, corrected using measures of the losses of PRCs, were in good agreement with separately measured equilibrium concentrations in a well-mixed system. Concentrations in the PE passive samplers, normalized by their polyethylene-water partition coefficients, were also in good agreement with directly measured porewater concentrations. Finally, PE-deduced porewater concentrations were compared with the traditional equilibrium partitioning models and showed that considering sorption to only organic carbon substantially overestimated porewater concentrations. However, predictions improved greatly if sorption to black carbon was also considered.},

In this study, we performed the calibration of a promising tool, the passive stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), which has previously shown good performances for semi-quantitative monitoring of pesticides in a field study. We determined the sampling rates and lag-phases of 18 moderately hydrophobic to hydrophobic agricultural pesticides (2.18{\textless}log Kow{\textless}5.11) from different chemical classes including triazines, substituted ureas, triazoles and organophosphate compounds. We also realised an elimination experiment to identify a performance reference compound (PRC). A flow-through calibration experiment was realised for 7 days at constant concentrations of target pesticides in tap water, under controlled temperature (20 degrees C) and flow velocity (2.5 cm s(-1)). Sampling rates were between 1.3 and 121 mL d(-1) with satisfactory RSD for most pesticides (9-47\%), and poor repeatability for 3 hydrophobic pesticides (59-83\%). Lag-phases for all target pesticides were shorter than 2 h, demonstrating the efficiency of passive SBSE for the integration of transient concentration peaks of these contaminants in surface waters. The role of flow velocity on pesticide uptakes was investigated and we assumed a water boundary layer-controlled mass transfer for 5 pesticides with log Kow{\textgreater}3.3. Among these pesticides, we selected fenitrothion to evaluate its elimination, along with its deuterated analogue. Results showed 82\% elimination of both compounds over the 7-day experiment and isotropic exchange for fenitrothion, making fenitrothion-d6 a promising PRC candidate for in situ applications.},

	abstract = {Despite recent data that suggest that the overall performance of drug-eluting stents (DES) is superior to that of bare-metal stents, the long-term safety and efficacy of DES remain controversial. The risk of late stent thrombosis associated with the use of DES has also motivated the development of a new and promising treatment option in recent years, namely drug-coated balloons (DCB). Contrary to DES where the drug of choice is typically sirolimus and its derivatives, DCB use paclitaxel since the use of sirolimus does not appear to lead to satisfactory results. Since both sirolimus and paclitaxel are highly lipophilic drugs with similar transport properties, the reason for the success of paclitaxel but not sirolimus in DCB remains unclear. Computational models of the transport of drugs eluted from DES or DCB within the arterial wall promise to enhance our understanding of the performance of these devices. The present study develops a computational model of the transport of the two drugs paclitaxel and sirolimus eluted from DES in the arterial wall. The model takes into account the multilayered structure of the arterial wall and incorporates a reversible binding model to describe drug interactions with the constituents of the arterial wall. The present results demonstrate that the transport of paclitaxel in the arterial wall is dominated by convection while the transport of sirolimus is dominated by the binding process. These marked differences suggest that drug release kinetics of DES should be tailored to the type of drug used.},

Results from each method are compared and contrasted in order to provide information for future investigators to use while selecting appropriate sampling methods for their research. The continuous low-level aquatic monitoring (CLAM) sampler (C.I.Agent(R) Storm-Water Solutions) is a submersible, low flow-rate sampler, that continuously draws water through solid-phase extraction media. CLAM samplers were deployed at two wastewater-dominated stream field sites in conjunction with the deployment of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and the collection of discrete (grab) water samples. All samples were analyzed for a suite of 69 TOCs. The CLAM and POCIS samples represent time-integrated samples that accumulate the TOCs present in the water over the deployment period (19-23 h for CLAM and 29 days for POCIS); the discrete samples represent only the TOCs present in the water at the time and place of sampling. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to examine patterns in both TOC detections and relative concentrations between the three sampling methods. A greater number of TOCs were detected in the CLAM samples than in corresponding discrete and POCIS samples, but TOC concentrations in the CLAM samples were significantly lower than in the discrete and (or) POCIS samples. Thirteen TOCs of varying polarity were detected by all of the three methods. TOC detections and concentrations obtained by the three sampling methods, however, are dependent on multiple factors. This study found that stream discharge, constituent loading, and compound type all affected TOC concentrations detected by each method. In addition, TOC detections and concentrations were affected by the reporting limits, bias, recovery, and performance of each method.},

	abstract = {The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a rhamnolipid biosurfactant on biodegradation of (14)C-labeled phenanthrene and pyrene under desorption-limiting conditions. The rhamnolipid caused a significant solubilization and enhanced biodegradation of PAHs sorbed to soils. The enhancement was, however, negatively influenced by experimental conditions that caused an enrichment of slow desorption fractions. These conditions included aging, a higher organic matter content in soil, and previous extraction with Tenax to remove the labile-desorbing chemical. The decline in bioavailability caused by aging on sorbed (14)C-pyrene was partially reversed by rhamnolipids, which enhanced mineralization of the aged compound, although not so efficiently like with the unaged chemical. This loss in biosurfactant efficiency in promoting biodegradation can be explained by intra-aggregate diffusion of the pollutant during aging. We suggest that rhamnolipid can enhance biodegradation of soil-sorbed PAHs by micellar solubilization, which increase the cell exposure to the chemicals in the aqueous phase, and partitioning into soil organic matter, thus enhancing the kinetics of slow desorption. Our study show that rhamnolipid can constitute a valid alternative to chemical surfactants in promoting the biodegradation of slow desorption PAHs, which constitutes a major bottleneck in bioremediation.},

	abstract = {The most commonly used passive air sampler (PAS) (i.e. polyurethane foam (PUF) disk) is cheap, versatile, and capable of accumulating compounds present both in gas and particle phases. Its performance for particle associated compounds is however disputable. In this study, twelve sets of triplicate PUF-PAS were deployed outdoors for exposure periods of 1-12 weeks together with continuously operated active samplers, to characterize sampling efficiency and derive sampling rates (RS) for compounds belonging to 7 SVOC classes (including particle associated compounds). PUF-PAS efficiently and consistently sampled polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and eight novel brominated flame retardant (nBFR) compounds. Low accuracy and lack of sensitivity was observed for most polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans PCDD/Fs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (under the conditions of this study), with the exception of some congeners which may be used as qualitative markers for their respective classes. Application of compound specific RS was found crucial for all compounds except PCBs. Sampling efficiency of the particle associated compounds was often low.},

After the determination of the best conditions of extraction, the tool was applied to spiked water to calculate the dissolved organic carbon water distribution coefficient (K(DOC)) in presence of different mixtures of PAHs and Aldrich humic acid. The use of deuterated naphthalene as internal standard for freely dissolved PAH quantification was shown to provide more accuracy than regular external calibration. For the first time, K(DOC) values of 18 PAHs were calculated using data from SPME-GC-MS and fluorescence quenching; they were in agreement with the results of previous studies. Competition between PAHs, deuterated PAHs and DOM was demonstrated, pointing out the non-linearity of PAH-DOM interactions and the stronger interactions of light molecular weight PAHs (higher K(DOC) values) in absence of high molecular weight PAHs.},

We also conducted a microcosm experiment to determine the SDB-disk sampling rates and provide a free-software solution to derive sampling rates under time-variable exposure. Sampling rates ranged from 0.26 to 0.77 L d(-1) and time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations from 0.05 to 2.11 mug/L. The 2 sampling systems were in good agreement and EDS exceeded TWA concentrations on average by a factor of 3. Our study demonstrates that passive sampling is suitable to quantify episodic exposures from polar organic pesticides.},

A second aim is to assess the efficiency of performance reference compounds (PRCs) to correct for the impact of water velocity. SR and LDPE samplers were spiked with 11 or 12 PRCs and exposed for 6 weeks to four different velocities (in the range of 1.6 to 37.7 cm s(-1)) in river-like flow conditions using a channel system supplied with river water. A relationship between velocity and the uptake was found for each iPCB and enables to determine expected changes in the uptake due to velocity variations. For both samplers, velocity increases from 2 to 10 cm s(-1), 30 cm s(-1) (interpolated data) and 100 cm s(-1) (extrapolated data) lead to increases of the uptake which do not exceed a factor of 2, 3 and 4.5, respectively. Results also showed that the influence of velocity decreased with increasing the octanol-water coefficient partition (log K(ow)) of iPCBs when SR is used whereas the opposite effect was observed for LDPE. Time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of iPCBs in water were calculated from iPCB uptake and PRC release. These calculations were performed using either a single PRC or all the PRCs. The efficiency of PRCs to correct the impact of velocity was assessed by comparing the TWA concentrations obtained at the four tested velocities. For SR, a good agreement was found among the four TWA concentrations with both methods (average RSD{\textless}10\%). Also for LDPE, PRCs offered a good correction of the impact of water velocity (average RSD of about 10 to 20\%). These results contribute to the process of acceptance of passive sampling in routine regulatory monitoring programs.},

The experimental procedures were conducted by examining interactions of arsenate and arsenite with different concentrations of humic acid (HA) as a model representative of NOM, in the presence of iron oxide based adsorbent (IBA), as a model solid surface in three environmentally relevant conditions, including the simultaneous adsorption of both As and HA onto IBA, HA adsorption onto As-presorbed IBA, and As adsorption onto HA-presorbed IBA. Experimental adsorption-desorption data were all fitted by original and modified Lagergren pseudo-first and -second order adsorption kinetic models, respectively. Weber's intraparticle diffusion was also used to gain insight into the mechanisms and rate controlling steps, which the results suggested that intraparticle diffusion of As species onto IBA is the main rate-controlling step. Different concentrations of HA mediated the redox transformation of As species, with a higher oxidation ability than reduction. The overall results indicated the significant effect of organic matter on the adsorption kinetics and redox transformation of As species, and consequently, the fate, transport and mobility of As in different environmentally relevant conditions.},

	abstract = {Cell signalling processes involve receptor trafficking through highly connected networks of interacting components. The binding of surface receptors to their specific ligands is a key factor for the control and triggering of signalling pathways. But the binding process still presents many enigmas and, by analogy with surface catalytic reactions, two different mechanisms can be conceived: the first mechanism is related to the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism, i.e. the bulk-dissolved ligand interacts directly by pure three-dimensional (3D) diffusion with the specific surface receptor; the second mechanism is similar to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) process, i.e. 3D diffusion of the ligand to the cell surface followed by reversible ligand adsorption and subsequent two-dimensional (2D) surface diffusion to the receptor. A situation where both mechanisms simultaneously contribute to the signalling process could also occur. The aim of this paper is to perform a computational study of the behavior of the signalling response when these different mechanisms for ligand-receptor interactions are integrated into a model for signal transduction and ligand transport. To this end, partial differential equations have been used to develop spatio-temporal models that show trafficking dynamics of ligands, cell surface components, and intracellular signalling molecules through the different domains of the system. The mathematical modeling developed for these mechanisms has been applied to the study of two situations frequently found in cell systems: (a) dependence of the signal response on cell density; and (b) enhancement of the signalling response in a synaptic environment.},

	abstract = {The environmental chemodynamics of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) are often rate-limited by diffusion in stagnant boundary layers. This study investigated whether motile microorganisms can act as microbial carriers that enhance mass transfer of HOCs through diffusive boundary layers. A new experimental system was developed that allows (1) generation of concentration gradients of HOCs under the microscope, (2) exposure and direct observation of microorganisms in such gradients, and (3) quantification of HOC mass transfer. Silicone O-rings were integrated into a Dunn chemotaxis chamber to serve as sink and source for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This resulted in stable concentration gradients in water ({\textgreater}24 h). Adding the model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis to the experimental system enhanced PAH mass transfer up to hundred-fold (benzo[a]pyrene). Increasing mass transfer enhancement with hydrophobicity indicated PAH co-transport with the motile organisms. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed such transport. The effective diffusivity of T. pyriformis, determined by video imaging microscopy, was found to exceed molecular diffusivities of the PAHs up to four-fold. Cell-bound PAH fractions were determined to range from 28\% (naphthalene) to 92\% (pyrene). Motile microorganisms can therefore function as effective carriers for HOCs under diffusive conditions and might significantly enhance mobility and availability of HOCs.},

	abstract = {Lopinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor with high protein binding (98-99\%) in human plasma. This study was designed to develop an ultrafiltration method to measure the unbound concentrations of lopinavir overcoming the non-specific binding issue. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of total concentrations of lopinavir in plasma was developed and validated, and an adaptation was also optimized and validated for the determination of unbound concentrations. The chromatographic separation was performed with a C18 column (100 mm x 2.1mm i.d., 5 mum particle size) using a mobile phase containing deionized water with formic acid, and acetonitrile, with gradient elution at a flow-rate of 350 muL min(-1). Identification of the compounds was performed by multiple reaction monitoring, using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. The method was validated over a clinical range of 0.01-1 mug/mL for human plasma ultrafiltrate and 0.1-15 mug/mL in human plasma. The inter and intra-assay accuracies and precisions were between 0.23\% and 11.37\% for total lopinavir concentrations, and between 3.50\% and 13.30\% for plasma ultrafiltrate (unbound concentration). The ultrafiltration method described allows an accurate separation of the unbound fraction of lopinavir, circumscribing the loss of drug by nonspecific binding (NSB), and the validated LC-MS/MS methodology proposed is suitable for the determination of total and unbound concentrations of lopinavir in clinical practice.},

A modified polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) is able to quantify aqueous PFCs. However, with varying external water velocity, PFC sampling rates (Rs) may change, affecting accuracy of derived water concentrations. To facilitate field deployment of this sampler, two methods of in-situ calibration were investigated: performance reference compounds (PRCs) and passive flow monitors (PFMs). Increased Rs's (by factors of 1.2-1.9) with PFM loss rate (g d(-1)) were observed for some PFCs. Results indicate PFMs can be used to correct PFC specific Rs's for more reliable estimates of environmental concentrations with a precision of about 0.01 L d(-1). Empirical models presented provide an improved means for aquatic monitoring of PFCs. The PRC approach was unsuccessful, confirming concern as to its applicability with such samplers.},

	abstract = {Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is increasingly employed for the treatment of early stage breast cancer. One of the key challenges in BCS is to ensure complete removal of the tumour while conserving as much healthy tissue as possible. In this study we have investigated the potential of Raman micro-spectroscopy (RMS) for automated intra-operative evaluation of tumour excision. First, a multivariate classification model based on Raman spectra of normal and malignant breast tissue samples was built and achieved diagnosis of mammary ductal carcinoma (DC) with 95.6\% sensitivity and 96.2\% specificity (5-fold cross-validation). The tumour regions were discriminated from the healthy tissue structures based on increased concentration of nucleic acids and reduced concentration of collagen and fat. The multivariate classification model was then applied to sections from fresh tissue of new patients to produce diagnosis images for DC. The diagnosis images obtained by raster scanning RMS were in agreement with the conventional histopathology diagnosis but were limited to long data acquisition times (typically 10,000 spectra mm(-2), which is equivalent to {\textasciitilde}5 h mm(-2)). Selective-sampling based on integrated auto-fluorescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy was used to reduce the number of Raman spectra to {\textasciitilde}20 spectra mm(-2), which is equivalent to an acquisition time of {\textasciitilde}15 min for 5 x 5 mm(2) tissue samples. This study suggests that selective-sampling Raman microscopy has the potential to provide a rapid and objective intra-operative method to detect mammary carcinoma in tissue and assess resection margins.},

Theoretically derived analytical results are based on the exact solution of Fick's second law of diffusion for a composite sphere, while numerical data are obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. In both cases, and for the range of matrix parameter values considered in this work, fractional drug release profiles are described accurately by a stretched exponential function. The release kinetics obtained is quantified through a detailed investigation of the dependence of the two stretched exponential release parameters on the device characteristics, namely the geometrical radii of the inner core and outer shell and the corresponding drug diffusion coefficients. Similar behaviors are revealed by both the theoretical results and the numerical simulations, and approximate analytical expressions are presented for the dependencies.},

These samplers were spiked with performance reference compounds (PRCs) and then simultaneously exposed under constant agitation and temperature in a 200 L stainless steel tank for periods ranging from one day to three months. A constant PCB concentration of about 1 ng.L(-1) was achieved by immersing a large amount of silicone rubber sheets ("dosing sheets") spiked with the target PCBs. The uptake of PCBs in the five samplers showed overall good repeatability and their accumulation was linear with time. The samplers SPMD, silicone rubber and LDPE strip were the most promising in terms of achieving low limits of quantification. Time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of PCBs in water were estimated from uptake of PCBs using the sampling rates calculated from the release of PRCs. Except for Chemcatcher, a good agreement was found between the different samplers and TWA concentrations ranged between 0.4 and 2.8 times the nominal water concentration. Finally, the influence of calculation methods (sampler-water partition coefficients, selected PRCs, models) on final TWA concentrations was studied.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery with heart-lung machine support, adequate anticoagulation to mitigate blood clotting caused by the artificial surfaces of the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) system is essential. These patients routinely receive heparin, whose effectiveness is monitored by measurements of the activated clotting time (ACT). However, ACT values only poorly correlate with the actual hemostatic status. The aim of our study was to evaluate the detection of free thrombin in heparinized human blood as a monitor of anticoagulation during ECC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human whole blood was anticoagulated with different concentrations of heparin (0.75, 1, 2 or 3 IU/ml) and circulated in the Chandler-loop model for up to 240 min at 37 degrees C. Next to ACT, ECC-mediated changes in free active thrombin, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin-III (TAT) levels were measured before and during circulation. Platelet activation and cell count parameters were further investigated. RESULTS: Our study shows that detection of ECC-mediated changes in free thrombin is possible in blood anticoagulated with 0.75 or 1 IU/ml heparin, whereas no thrombin was detectable at higher heparin concentrations. Thrombin generation during 240 min of ECC is comparable to F 1+2 and TAT plasma levels during ECC. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombin is the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade and hence represents a promising marker for monitoring the coagulation status of patients. Although detection of free thrombin was not feasible at high heparin concentrations, the employed test represents an additional test to current laboratory methods investigating blood coagulation at low heparin concentrations.},

However, a wide range of techniques and configurations are currently used (active and passive samplers, different deployment times, different sorbents, etc.) and as the SVOC community looks to assess air measurements on a global scale, questions of comparability arise. We review current air sampling techniques, with a focus on sampling artifacts that can lead to uncertainties or biases in reported concentrations, in particular breakthrough, degradation, meteorological influences, and assumptions regarding passive sampling. From this assessment, we estimate the bias introduced for SVOC concentrations from all factors. Due to the effects of breakthrough, degradation, particle fractions and sampler uptake periods, some current passive and active sampler configurations may underestimate certain SVOCs by 30-95\%. We then recommend future study design, appropriateness of sampler types for different study goals, and finally, how the SVOC community should move forward in both research and monitoring to best achieve comparability and consistency in air measurements.},

	abstract = {Combining specific recognition capabilities with the excellent spatiotemporal resolution of small electrodes represents a promising methodology in bioanalytical and chemical sensing. In this paper, we report the development of reproducible electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors on a gold microelectrode platform. Specifically, we develop microscale sensors (25 mum diameter) for two representative small molecule targets-adenosine triphosphate and tobramycin. Furthermore, we report on the challenges encountered at this size scale including small-magnitude signals and interference from the irreversible reduction of dissolved oxygen and present methods to circumvent these challenges. Through the electrochemical deposition of dendritic gold nanostructures, we demonstrate microscale sensors with improved performance by increasing signal-to-noise and consequently sensitivity. Finally, we report on the use of the nonspecific adsorption of serum proteins as an additional layer of surface passivation for stable sensor performance. The sensor development here represents general guidelines for fabricating electrochemical, folding aptamer-based sensors on small-scale electrodes.},

	abstract = {Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that is resistant to many antibiotics. Resistance to methicillin is related to production of penicillin binding protein 2a (PBP2a). The currently presented research involves the development of antibody-linked immunoaffinity solid phase microextraction (SPME) sorbents characterized from several aspects that can identify protein PBP2a. The on-sorbent binding constant Kd of monoclonal anti-PBP2a antibody for its antigen protein PBP2a was determined to be 4x10(-10) M. This value was obtained on the basis of the binding curve determined by selective extraction of its antigen PBP2a at different concentrations. The concentration of PBP2a captured by immunoaffinity sorbents was as low as 10ng/mL; lower concentrations could not be tested due to the sensitivity limitation of the LC-MS/MS system available. Surface density was estimated at 59 ng antibody/cm(2). To reduce non-specific binding, especially when the antigen is a protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to pretreat surfaces. The established immunoaffinity platform technology is expected to provide insights into the development of a practical, specific, sensitive and accurate assay for in vitro and in vivo diagnostics of MRSA.},

After sampling, the next step in the analytical process is sample preparation. Because of the low concentration levels of drug in plasma and the variety of the metabolites, the selected extraction technique should be virtually exhaustive. Recent developments of sample handling techniques are directed, from one side, toward automatization and online coupling of sample preparation units. The primary objective of this review is to present the recent developments in microextraction sample preparation methods for analysis of drugs in biological fluids. Microextraction techniques allow for less consumption of solvent, reagents, and packing materials, and small sample volumes can be used. In this review the use of solid phase microextraction (SPME), microextraction in packed sorbent (MEPS), and stir-bar sorbtive extraction (SBSE) in drug analysis will be discussed. In addition, the use of new sorbents such as monoliths and molecularly imprinted polymers will be presented.},

	abstract = {Until recently, sample preparation was carried out using traditional techniques, such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), that use large volumes of organic solvents. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) uses much less solvent than LLE, although the volume can still be significant. These preparation methods are expensive, time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly. Recently, a great effort has been made to develop new analytical methodologies able to perform direct analyses using miniaturised equipment, thereby achieving high enrichment factors, minimising solvent consumption and reducing waste. These microextraction techniques improve the performance during sample preparation, particularly in complex water environmental samples, such as wastewaters, surface and ground waters, tap waters, sea and river waters. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and time-of-flight mass spectrometric (TOF/MS) techniques can be used when analysing a broad range of organic micropollutants. Before separating and detecting these compounds in environmental samples, the target analytes must be extracted and pre-concentrated to make them detectable. In this work, we review the most recent applications of microextraction preparation techniques in different water environmental matrices to determine organic micropollutants: solid-phase microextraction SPME, in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME), stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and liquid-phase microextraction (LPME). Several groups of compounds are considered organic micropollutants because these are being released continuously into the environment. Many of these compounds are considered emerging contaminants. These analytes are generally compounds that are not covered by the existing regulations and are now detected more frequently in different environmental compartments. Pharmaceuticals, surfactants, personal care products and other chemicals are considered micropollutants. These compounds must be monitored because, although they are detected in low concentrations, they might be harmful toward ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Adsorption of cellulases on the cellulose surface is an integral part of the catalytic mechanism, and a detailed description of the adsorption process is therefore required for a fundamental understanding of this industrially important class of enzymes. However, the mode of adsorption has proven intricate, and several key questions remain open. Perhaps most notably it is not clear whether the adsorbed enzyme is in dynamic equilibrium with the free population or irreversibly associated with no or slow dissociation. To address this, we have systematically investigated adsorption reversibility for two cellobiohydrolases (Cel7A and Cel6A) and one endoglucanase (Cel7B) on four types of pure cellulose substrates. Specifically, we monitored dilution-induced release of adsorbed enzyme in samples that had previously been brought to a steady state (constant concentration of free enzyme). In simple dilution experiments (without centrifugation), the results consistently showed full reversibility. In contrast to this, resuspension of enzyme-substrate pellets separated by centrifugation showed extensive irreversibility. We conclude that these enzymes are in a dynamic equilibrium between free and adsorbed states but suggest that changes in the physical properties of cellulose caused by compaction of the pellet hampers subsequent release of adsorbed enzyme. This latter effect may be pertinent to both previous controversies in the literature on adsorption reversibility and the development of enzyme recycling protocols in the biomass industry.},

	abstract = {The human population continues to grow exponentially in the fast developing and most populated countries, whereas in Western Europe it is getting older and older each year. This inevitably raises the demand for better and more efficient medical services without increasing the economic burden in the same proportion. To meet these requirements, improvement of medical diagnosis is certainly a key aspect to consider. Therefore, we need powerful analytical methodologies able to go deeper and further in the characterization of human metabolism and identification of disease biomarkers and endogenous molecules in body fluids and tissues. The ultimate goal is to have a reliable and early medical diagnosis, mitigating the disease complications as much as possible. Microextraction techniques (METs) represent a key step in these analytical methodologies by providing samples in the suitable volumes and purification levels necessary for the characterization of the target analytes. In this aspect, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and, more recently, microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS), are powerful sample preparation techniques, characterized by their reduced time of analysis, low solvent consumption, and broad application. Moreover, as miniaturized techniques, they can be easily automatized to have a high-throughput performance in the clinical environment. In this review, we explore some of the most interesting MEPS and SPME applications, focusing on recent trends and applications to medical diagnostic, particularly the in vivo and near real time applications.},

A limited number of analytical techniques are sensitive enough for the direct determination of trace components in samples and, because of that, a preliminary step of the analyte isolation/enrichment prior to analysis is required in many cases. In this work the newest trends and innovations in liquid phase microextraction, like: single-drop microextraction (SDME), hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME), and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) have been discussed, including their critical evaluation and possible application in analytical practice. The described modifications of extraction techniques deal with system miniaturization and/or automation, the use of ultrasound and physical agitation, and electrochemical methods. Particular attention was given to pro-ecological aspects therefore the possible use of novel, non-toxic extracting agents, inter alia, ionic liquids, coacervates, surfactant solutions and reverse micelles in the liquid phase microextraction techniques has been evaluated in depth. Also, new methodological solutions and the related instruments and devices for the efficient liquid phase micoextraction of analytes, which have found application at the stage of procedure prior to chromatographic determination, are presented.},

The sample preparation of target compounds from biological, pharmaceutical, environmental, and food matrices is one of the most time-consuming steps in the analytical procedure. The microextraction techniques are dominant. Metabolomic studies also require application of proper analytical technique for the determination of endogenic metabolites present in biological matrix on trace concentration levels. Due to the reproducibility of data, precision, relatively low cost of the appropriate analysis, simplicity of the determination, and the possibility of direct combination of those techniques with other methods (combination types on-line and off-line), they have become the most widespread in routine determinations. Additionally, sample pretreatment procedures have to be more selective, cheap, quick, and environmentally friendly. This review summarizes the current achievements and applications of microextraction techniques. The main aim is to deal with the utilization of different types of sorbents for microextraction and emphasize the use of new synthesized sorbents as well as to bring together studies concerning the systematic approach to method development.

	abstract = {Simple, fast and efficient sample preparation approaches that allow high-throughput isolation of various compounds from complex matrices are highly desired in bioanalysis. Particularly sought are methods that can, without sacrificing time, easily remove matrix interferences capable of inducing ionization suppression/enhancement, or causing detrimental effects in instrumental performance. In this work, an automated high-throughput sample preparation method using thin film solid phase microextraction (SPME) for the analysis of multiple prohibited substances in plasma is proposed. A biocompatible SPME extraction phase made of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance particles immobilized with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) demonstrated satisfactory extraction capabilities for 25 compounds of a wide range of polarities (logP from -2 to 6.8). Due to the well-known biocompatible characteristics of PAN-based SPME coatings, minimum sample handling was required. Experimental conditions for pre-conditioning, extraction, wash and desorption were carefully optimized for the proposed method. By taking full advantage of the 96 thin film handling capability of the automated system, a preparation time of approximately 1.5min per sample can be achieved. Satisfactory results in terms of absolute matrix effects were found for the majority of the studied analytes, given that 24 out of 25 compounds exhibited values in the range of 100 and 120\%. The method was validated in terms of linearity (R(2){\textgreater}0.99), inter and intra-day accuracy (85-130\%) and precision ({\textless}20\%) and limits of quantitation (0.25-10ngmL(-1) for most compounds).},

The remedy at the first two locations was capping over PAH contaminated sediments while at Hunter's Point, the assessment was part of an in situ treatment demonstration led by R. G. Luthy (Stanford University) using activated carbon mixed into PCB contaminated sediments. The implementation and results at these contaminated sediment sites were used to illustrate the utility and usefulness of the passive sampling approach. Two different approaches were employed to evaluate kinetics of uptake onto the sorbent fibers. At the capping sites, the passive sampling approach was employed to measure intermixing during cap placement, contamination migration into the cap post-placement and recontamination over time. At the in situ treatment demonstration site, reductions in porewater concentrations in treated versus untreated sediments were compared to measurements of bioaccumulation of PCBs in Neanthes arenaceodentata.},

Importantly, the model allows for the first time for the quantitative prediction of the effects of the composition, dimensions and type of preparation method of the tablets on the resulting niacin release kinetics. These quantitative theoretical model predictions were confirmed by several sets of independent experimental results. Furthermore, in silico simulations revealed the fundamental importance of limited niacin solubility within the lipid tablets: during major parts of the release periods, very steep concentration gradients exist and net vitamin flux is restricted to specific regions within the tablets.},

Knowledge of the spatio-temporal drug uptake in the arterial wall is useful for investigating restenosis growth but may often be very expensive/difficult to acquire experimentally. In this study, local delivery of a hydrophobic drug from a drug-eluting stent implanted in a coronary artery is mathematically modelled to investigate the drug release and spatio-temporal drug distribution in the arterial wall. The model integrates drug diffusion in the coating and drug diffusion with reversible binding in the arterial wall. The model is solved by the finite volume method for both high and low drug loadings relative to its solubility in the stent coating with varied isotropic-anisotropic vascular drug diffusivities. Drug release profiles in the coating are observed to depend not only on the coating drug diffusivity but also on the properties of the surrounding arterial wall. Time dependencies of the spatially averaged free- and bound-drug levels in the arterial wall on the coating and vascular drug diffusivities are discussed. Anisotropic vascular drug diffusivities result in slightly different average drug levels in the arterial wall but with very different spatial distributions. Higher circumferential vascular diffusivity results in more uniform drug loading in the upper layers and is potentially beneficial in reducing in-stent restenosis. An analytical expression is derived which can be used to determine regions in the arterial with higher free-drug concentration than bound-drug concentration.},

Herein, we outline the development of a simple mathematical relationship of the environmental, polymer, and chemical properties that control the uptake rate. This relationship, called a timescale, is then used to illustrate how each property controls the rate of equilibration in samplers deployed in the water or in the sediment.

	abstract = {In chemical analysis, sample preparation is frequently considered the bottleneck of the entire analytical method. The success of the final method strongly depends on understanding the entire process of analysis of a particular type of analyte in a sample, namely: the physicochemical properties of the analytes (solubility, volatility, polarity etc.), the environmental conditions, and the matrix components of the sample. Various sample preparation strategies have been developed based on exhaustive or non-exhaustive extraction of analytes from matrices. Undoubtedly, amongst all sample preparation approaches, liquid extraction, including liquid-liquid (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE), are the most well-known, widely used, and commonly accepted methods by many international organizations and accredited laboratories. Both methods are well documented and there are many well defined procedures, which make them, at first sight, the methods of choice. However, many challenging tasks, such as complex matrix applications, on-site and in vivo applications, and determination of matrix-bound and free concentrations of analytes, are not easily attainable with these classical approaches for sample preparation. In the last two decades, the introduction of solid phase microextraction (SPME) has brought significant progress in the sample preparation area by facilitating on-site and in vivo applications, time weighted average (TWA) and instantaneous concentration determinations. Recently introduced matrix compatible coatings for SPME facilitate direct extraction from complex matrices and fill the gap in direct sampling from challenging matrices. Following introduction of SPME, numerous other microextraction approaches evolved to address limitations of the above mentioned techniques. There is not a single method that can be considered as a universal solution for sample preparation. This review aims to show the main advantages and limitations of the above mentioned sample preparation approaches and the applicability and capability of each technique for challenging cases such as complex matrices, on-site applications and automation.},

Conventional SPME-GC/MS also was used for the analysis of volatiles present in skin samples and for the analysis of volatiles present in the diet and terraria. In total, 40 and 37 compounds were identified in the secretion of Hypsiboas pulchellus and H. riojanus, respectively, of which, 35 were common to both species. Aliphatic aldehydes, a low molecular weight alkadiene, an aromatic alcohol, and other aromatics, ketones, a methoxy pyrazine, sulfur containing compounds, and hemiterpenes are reported here for the first time in anurans. Most of the aliphatic compounds seem to be biosynthesized by the frogs following different metabolic pathways, whereas aromatics and monoterpenes are most likely sequestered from environmental sources. The characteristic smell of the secretion of H. pulchellus described by herpetologists as skunk-like or herbaceous is explained by a complex blend of different odoriferous components. The possible role of the volatiles found in H. pulchellus and H. riojanus is discussed in the context of previous hypotheses about the biological function of volatile secretions in frogs (e.g., sex pheromones, defense secretions against predators, mosquito repellents).},

The aims of the present study were to assess this new passive sampler for the determination of representative average concentrations and to evaluate the contamination levels of two French rivers. Passive SBSE was evaluated for the monitoring of 16 pesticides in two rivers located in a small vineyard watershed during two 1-month field campaigns in spring 2010 and spring 2011. Passive SBSE was applied for periods of 1 or 2 weeks during the field campaigns and compared with spot sampling and weekly average automated sampling. The results showed that passive SBSE could achieve better time-representativeness than spot sampling and lower limits of quantification than automated sampling coupled with analytical SBSE for the pesticides studied. Finally, passive SBSE proved useful for revealing spatial and temporal variations in pesticide contamination of both rivers and the impact of rainfall and runoff on the river water quality.},

	abstract = {A new and simple method for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene (BTEX) quantification in vehicle exhaust was developed based on diffusion-controlled extraction onto a retracted solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber coating. The rationale was to develop a method based on existing and proven SPME technology that is feasible for field adaptation in developing countries. Passive sampling with SPME fiber retracted into the needle extracted nearly two orders of magnitude less mass (n) compared with exposed fiber (outside of needle) and sampling was in a time weighted-averaging (TWA) mode. Both the sampling time (t) and fiber retraction depth (Z) were adjusted to quantify a wider range of Cgas. Extraction and quantification is conducted in a non-equilibrium mode. Effects of Cgas, t, Z and T were tested. In addition, contribution of n extracted by metallic surfaces of needle assembly without SPME coating was studied. Effects of sample storage time on n loss was studied. Retracted TWA-SPME extractions followed the theoretical model. Extracted n of BTEX was proportional to Cgas, t, Dg, T and inversely proportional to Z. Method detection limits were 1.8, 2.7, 2.1 and 5.2 mg m(-3) (0.51, 0.83, 0.66 and 1.62 ppm) for BTEX, respectively. The contribution of extraction onto metallic surfaces was reproducible and influenced by Cgas and t and less so by T and by the Z. The new method was applied to measure BTEX in the exhaust gas of a Ford Crown Victoria 1995 and compared with a whole gas and direct injection method.},

These experiments are often carried out by exposing passive samplers in a finite water volume, and errors are easily made when the obtained results are applied to the field, where water volumes are essentially infinite. The effect of water volume on the equilibration rate constant is discussed, using a mechanistic model. Application of this model to two literature reports illustrates that aqueous concentrations in the field may be underestimated by a factor of 10 or more, when the water volume effect is neglected. Finally, it is shown that the concept of "sorption capacity" (sampler mass times partition coefficient) allows for a more intuitive understanding of the passive sampling process in small and large water volumes, which may reduce the risk of laboratory-field extrapolation errors.},

	abstract = {Drug-eluting stents (DES), which release anti-proliferative drugs into the arterial wall in a controlled manner, have drastically reduced the rate of in-stent restenosis and revolutionized the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, late stent thrombosis remains a safety concern in DES, mainly due to delayed healing of the endothelial wound inflicted during DES implantation. We present a framework to optimize DES design such that restenosis is inhibited without affecting the endothelial healing process. To this end, we have developed a computational model of fluid flow and drug transport in stented arteries and have used this model to establish a metric for quantifying DES performance. The model takes into account the multi-layered structure of the arterial wall and incorporates a reversible binding model to describe drug interaction with the cells of the arterial wall. The model is coupled to a novel optimization algorithm that allows identification of optimal DES designs. We show that optimizing the period of drug release from DES and the initial drug concentration within the coating has a drastic effect on DES performance. Paclitaxel-eluting stents perform optimally by releasing their drug either very rapidly (within a few hours) or very slowly (over periods of several months up to one year) at concentrations considerably lower than current DES. In contrast, sirolimus-eluting stents perform optimally only when drug release is slow. The results offer explanations for recent trends in the development of DES and demonstrate the potential for large improvements in DES design relative to the current state of commercial devices.},

The in situ Rs values did not vary with flow rate and temperature. The empirical equation of the Rs value from the SPMDs was established. This infers that PRCs could be avoided by using an established empirical equation under similar field conditions. The sum of the bioavailable PAHs ranged from 0.281 to 0.611ngL(-1) on the eastern side of the Taiwan Strait and from 0.438 to 1.10ngL(-1) on the western side. Distinct sources and toxicity of these bioavailable PAHs were observed and mainly resulted from different types of energy consumption.},

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the use of passive sampling for measuring water column Cfree for several hydrophobic organic contaminants at 3 US Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites. Sites investigated included New Bedford Harbor (New Bedford, MA, USA), Palos Verdes Shelf (Los Angeles, CA, USA), and Naval Station Newport (Newport, RI, USA); and the passive samplers evaluated were polyethylene, polydimethylsiloxane-coated solid-phase microextraction fibers, semipermeable membrane devices, and polyoxymethylene. In general, the different passive samplers demonstrated good agreement, with Cfree values varying by a factor of 2 to 3. Further, at New Bedford Harbor, where conventional water sample concentrations were also measured (i.e., grab samples), passive sampler-based Cfree values agreed within a factor of 2. These findings suggest that all of the samplers were experiencing and measuring similar Cfree during their respective deployments. Also, at New Bedford Harbor, a strong log-linear, correlative, and predictive relationship was found between polyethylene passive sampler accumulation and lipid-normalized blue mussel bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (r(2) = 0.92, p {\textless} 0.05). The present study demonstrates the utility of passive sampling for generating scientifically accurate water column Cfree values, which is critical for making informed environmental management decisions at contaminated sediment sites.},

In general, contaminant concentrations were predicted well for whole water and biota. C(ww) was increasingly underpredicted as K(oc) increased, possibly because of the presence of black carbon. Concentrations in biota were overestimated by the equilibrium approach when logK(ow) exceeded 6.5, suggesting an increasing role of transformation processes. Concentrations of PAHs and PCBs in sediment and SPM were consistently underpredicted although a good correlation between measured and predicted values was observed. This was potentially due to the use of experimental K(oc) values which have been found to underestimate partitioning of hydrophobic substances to sediment in field studies.},

	abstract = {Understanding the labile status of phosphorus (P) in sediments is crucial for managing a eutrophic lake, but it is hindered by lacking in situ data particularly on a catchment scale. In this study, we for the first time characterized in situ labile P in sediments with the Zr-oxide diffusive gradients in thin films (Zr-oxide DGT) technique at a two-dimensional (2D), submillimeter resolution in a large eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China, with an area of 2338 km(2)). The concentration of DGT-labile P in the sediment profiles showed strong variation mostly ranging from 0.01 to 0.35 mg L(-1) with a considerable number of hotspots. The horizontal heterogeneity index of labile P varied from 0.04 to 4.5. High values appeared at the depths of 0-30 mm, likely reflecting an active layer of labile P under the sediment-water interface (SWI). Concentration gradients of labile P were observed from the high-resolution 1D DGT profiles in both the sediment and overlying water layers close to the SWI. The apparent diffusion flux of P across the SWI was calculated between -21 and 65 ng cm(-2) d(-1), which showed that the sediments tended to be a source and sink of overlying water P in the algal- and macrophyte-dominated regions, respectively. The DGT-labile P in the 0-30 mm active layer showed a better correlation with overlying water P than the labile P measured by ex situ chemical extraction methods. It implies that in situ, high-resolution profiling of labile P with DGT is a more reliable approach and will significantly extend our ability in in situ monitoring of the labile status of P in sediments in the field.},

Tests were done to better understand the samplers and the materials used. Measured dry deposition of GOM was significantly higher at sites {\textgreater}2000 m elevation relative to those below due to high GOM concentrations and atmospheric turbulence. At these high elevation sites, GOM dry deposition was higher in spring due to long-range transport from Asia (air parcels from the free troposphere) and some high GOM dry deposition events were related to regional emissions. Dry deposition of GOM at two sites was calculated using the passive sampler data and a multiple-resistance model. A previously developed relationship between the sampling rate of the passive sampler and GOM concentrations was used to estimate dry deposition and a scaling factor of 3 was used to adjust GOM concentrations, due to underestimation by KCl-coated denuder measurements. With the scaling factor of 3, modeled deposition was in the range of results estimated from two different models settings. However, dry deposition did not correlate consistently with either model. The disagreement could be due to uncertainties associated with measurements and/or modeling, or different GOM compounds existing in the atmosphere. If the atmospheric GOM compounds are known, dry deposition velocities could be estimated more accurately. Lastly, we investigated the potential for use of a new sampling material for GOM and checked the efficiency of the passive sampler.},

Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), protease inhibitors (PIs), efavirenz and nevirapine are highly bound to proteins.

	abstract = {This study aims to provide a passive sampling approach which can be routinely used to investigate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) sources in rivers. The approach consists of deploying low density polyethylene (LDPE) strips downstream and upstream of potential PCB sources as well as in their water discharges. Concentrations of indicator PCBs (iPCBs) absorbed in samplers (Cs) from upstream and downstream sites are compared with each other to reveal increases of PCB levels. Cs measured in water discharges are used to determine if released amounts of PCBs are compatible with increases revealed in the river. As water velocity can greatly vary along a river stretch and influences the uptake at each site in a different way, differences in velocity have to be taken into account to correctly interpret Cs. LDPE strips were exposed to velocities between 1.6 and 37 cm s-1 using a channel system built in the field. Relationships between velocity and Cs were established for each iPCB to determine the expected change in Cs due to velocity variations. For PCBs 28 and 52, this change does not exceed a factor 2 for velocity variations in the range from 1.6 to 100 cm s-1 (extrapolated data above 37 cm s-1). For PCBs 101, 138, 153 and 180, this change only exceeds a factor 2 in the case of large velocity variations. The approach was applied in the Swiss river Venoge to first conduct a primary investigation of potential PCB sources and then conduct thorough investigations of two suspected sources.},

	abstract = {A fully automated solid phase microextraction (SPME) depletion method was developed to study the partition coefficient of organic compound between complex matrix and water sample. The SPME depletion process was conducted by pre-loading the fiber with a specific amount of organic compounds from a proposed standard gas generation vial, and then desorbing the fiber into the targeted samples. Based on the proposed method, the partition coefficients (Kmatrix) of 4 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) between humic acid (HA)/hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-HPCD) and aqueous sample were determined. The results showed that the logKmatrix of 4 PAHs with HA and beta-HPCD ranged from 3.19 to 4.08, and 2.45 to 3.15, respectively. In addition, the logKmatrix values decreased about 0.12-0.27 log units for different PAHs for every 10 degrees C increase in temperature. The effect of temperature on the partition coefficient followed van't Hoff plot, and the partition coefficient at any temperature can be predicted based on the plot. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied for the real biological fluid analysis. The partition coefficients of 6 PAHs between the complex matrices in the fetal bovine serum and water were determined, and compared to ones obtained from SPME extraction method. The result demonstrated that the proposed method can be applied to determine the sorption coefficients of hydrophobic compounds between complex matrix and water in a variety of samples.},

	abstract = {Solid phase microextraction (SPME) has become a useful tool for in vivo monitoring the behavior of environmental organic pollutants in biological species due to its simplicity, relatively non-invasive, and cost-effective manner. However, the complex matrices in biological samples could significantly influence the extraction kinetic, and bias the quantification result. In this study, we investigated the effect of complex matrix on the extraction kinetic of SPME for biological sample analysis. Two sample matrices, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and agarose gel with BSA were used to simulate the biological fluid and tissue. Results showed that the addition of BSA significantly enhanced the mass transfer of organic compounds onto SPME fiber in both PBS buffer and gel sample. Enhancement factors ranging from 1.3 to 27, and 2.0 to 80 were found for all selected polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PBS buffer and agarose gel with BSA concentration of 0.1-5\%, respectively. Then, an improved theoretical model was applied to quantify the observed enhancement effect, and the result showed that the predicted sampling time constant agreed well with the experimental one in complex matrix. Furthermore, a simplified equation was proposed for the real biological sample analysis.},

	abstract = {Binding resin beads used in DGT (diffusion gradients in thin films) tend to settle to one side of the resin during casting. This phenomenon might be relevant for metal accumulation when partially labile complexes dominate the metal speciation, especially after recognizing the important role played by complex dissociation in the resin domain. The influence of the inhomogeneity of the binding agent distribution on metal accumulation is here assessed by numerical simulation of DGT devices with binding beads in only one half of the resin disc, as a reasonable model of the standard resin discs. Results indicate that a decrease in mass accumulation of less than 13\% can arise in these inhomogeneous devices (as compared with an ideal disc with homogeneous dispersion of the resin beads) when complexes with stability constant K{\textless}10(2)m(3)mol(-1) (K{\textless}10(5)Lmol(-1)) dominate the metal speciation. The loss increases as K increases, but the percentage of mass loss always remains lower than the volume fraction of resin disc without beads. For very labile or inert complexes, the impact of the inhomogeneous distribution of binding resin beads is negligible. As kinetic dissociation constants of complexes can be estimated from the distribution of the metal accumulation in a DGT device with a stack of two resin discs, the influence of the inhomogeneity on the recovered kinetic constant is also assessed. For the cases studied, the recovered kinetic dissociation constant, kd,recovered, retains the correct order of magnitude, being related to the true kd by kd approximately f(-1)kd,recovered, quite independently of K and kd values, being f the fraction of volume of the resin disc where resin beads are dispersed.},

PE samplers pre-loaded with PRCs were deployed at the surface, mid-column, and near bottom at sites representing the nearshore continental shelf off southern California (Santa Monica Bay, USA) and a mega commercial port (Los Angeles Harbor). After correcting for fractional equilibration using PRCs, concentrations ranged up to 100 pg L(-1) for PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 500 pg L(-1) for DDMU and 300 pg L(-1) for DDNU, and to 1000 pg L(-1) for p,p'-DDE. Seawater concentrations of DDTs and PCBs increased with depth, suggesting that bed sediments serve as the source of water column HOCs in Santa Monica Bay. In contrast, no discernable pattern between surface and near-bottom concentrations in Los Angeles Harbor was observed, which were also several-fold lower (DDTs: 45-300 pg L(-1), PCBs: 5-50 pg L(-1)) than those in Santa Monica Bay (DDTs: 2-1100 pg L(-1), PCBs: 2-250 pg L(-1)). Accumulation by mussels co-deployed with the PE samplers at select sites was strongly correlated with PE-estimated seawater concentrations, providing further evidence that these samplers are a viable alternative for monitoring of HOC exposure. Fractional equilibration observed with the PRCs increased with decreasing PRC molar volume indicating the importance of target compound physicochemical properties when estimating water column concentrations using passive samplers in situ.},

We show that under well-controlled experimental conditions the relative combined uncertainties of bulk DGT measurements are approximately 10\% at a confidence interval of 95\%. While several factors considerably contribute to the uncertainty of bulk DGT, the uncertainty of DGT LA-ICP-MS mainly depends on the signal variability of the ablation analysis.

	abstract = {The Langmuir adsorption isotherm provides one of the simplest and most direct methods to quantify an adsorption process. Because isotherm data from protein adsorption studies often appear to be fit well by the Langmuir isotherm model, estimates of protein binding affinity have often been made from its use despite that fact that none of the conditions required for a Langmuir adsorption process may be satisfied for this type of application. The physical events that cause protein adsorption isotherms to often provide a Langmuir-shaped isotherm can be explained as being due to changes in adsorption-induced spreading, reorientation, clustering, and aggregation of the protein on a surface as a function of solution concentration in contrast to being due to a dynamic equilibrium adsorption process, which is required for Langmuir adsorption. Unless the requirements of the Langmuir adsorption process can be confirmed, fitting of the Langmuir model to protein adsorption isotherm data to obtain thermodynamic properties, such as the equilibrium constant for adsorption and adsorption free energy, may provide erroneous values that have little to do with the actual protein adsorption process, and should be avoided. In this article, a detailed analysis of the Langmuir isotherm model is presented along with a quantitative analysis of the level of error that can arise in derived parameters when the Langmuir isotherm is inappropriately applied to characterize a protein adsorption process.},

	abstract = {An analytical method for the determination of phenolic compounds in air samples based on the use of cyclodextrin-silica hybrid microporous composite samplers is proposed. The method allows the determination of phenol, guaiacol, cresol isomers, eugenol, 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol in workplaces according to the Norm UNE-EN 1076:2009 for active sampling. Therefore, the proposed method offers an alternative for the assessment of the occupational exposure to phenol and cresol isomers. The detection limits of the proposed method are lower than those for the NIOSH Method 2546. Storage time of samples almost reaches 44 days. Recovery values for phenol, guaiacol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol, 4-ethylguaiacol, eugenol and 4-ethylphenol are 109\%, 99\%, 102\%, 94\%, 94\%, 91\%, 95\% and 102\%, respectively with a coefficient of variation below 6\%. The method has been applied to the assessment of exposure in different areas of a farm and regarding the quantification of these compounds in the vapors generated by burning incense sticks and an essential oil marketed as air fresheners. The acquired results are comparable with those provided from a reference method for a 95\% of confidence level. The possible use of these samplers for the sampling of other toxic compounds such as phthalates is evaluated by qualitative analysis of extracts from incense sticks and essential oil samples.},

	abstract = {A new approach for monitoring the binding affinity between drugs and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in real time was developed based on a combination of drug-protein reaction followed by Venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry determination of the free drug concentrations. A known basic drug, propranolol was used to validate the new built method. Binding constant values calculated by venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry was in good accordance with a traditional ultrafiltration combined with high performance liquid chromatography method. Then six types of basic drugs were used as the samples to conduct the real time analysis. Upon injection of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein to the drug mixture, the ion chromatograms were extracted to show the changes in the free drug concentrations in real time. By observing the drop-out of six types of drugs during the whole binding reaction, the binding affinities of different drugs were distinguished. A volume shift validating experiment and an injection delay correcting experiment were also performed to eliminate extraneous factors and verify the reliability of our experiment. Therefore, the features of Venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry (V-EASI-MS) and the experimental results indicate that our technique is likely to become a powerful tool for monitoring drug-AGP binding affinity in real time.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a general model of drug release from a drug delivery device and the subsequent transport in biological tissue. The model incorporates drug diffusion, dissolution and solubility in the polymer coating, coupled with diffusion, convection and reaction in the biological tissue. Each layer contains bound and free drug phases so that the resulting model is a coupled two-phase two-layer system of partial differential equations. One of the novelties is the generality of the model in each layer. Within the drug coating, our model includes diffusion as well as three different models of dissolution. We show that the model may also be used in cases where dissolution is rapid or not relevant, and additionally when drug release is not limited by its solubility. Within the biological tissue, the model can account for nonlinear saturable reversible binding, with linear reversible binding and linear irreversible binding being recovered as special cases. The generality of our model will allow the simulation of the release from a wide range of drug delivery devices encompassing many different applications. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model we simulate results for the particular application of drug release from arterial stents.},

	abstract = {In a large field study, the in-situ calibration of the Chemcatcher((R)) passive sampler - styrenedivinylbenzene (SDB) covered by a polyether sulfone (PES) membrane - was evaluated for 322 polar organic micropollutants. Five rivers with different agricultural and urban influences were monitored from March to July 2012 with two methods i) two-week time-proportional composite water samples and ii) two-week passive sampler deployment. All substances - from different substance classes with logKow -3 to 5, and neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic species - were analyzed by liquid-chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. This study showed that SDB passive samplers are well-suited for the qualitative screening of polar micropollutants because the number of detected substances was similar (204 for SDB samples vs. 207 for composite water samples), limits of quantification were comparable (median: 1.3 ng/L vs. 1.6 ng/L), and the handling in the field and laboratory is fast and easy. The determination of in-situ calibrated sampling rates (field Rs) was possible for 88 compounds where the R(2) from the regression (water concentration vs. sampled mass on SDB disk) was {\textgreater}0.75. Substances with moderately fluctuating river concentrations such as pharmaceuticals showed much better correlations than substances with highly fluctuating concentrations such as pesticides (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.75 for 93\% and 60\% of the investigated substances, respectively). Flow velocity (0.05-0.8 m/s) and temperature (5-20 degrees C) did not have an evident effect on the field Rs. It was observed that ionic species had significantly lower field Rs than neutral species. Due to the complexity of the different transport processes, a correlation between determined field Rs and logDow could only predict Rs with large uncertainties. We conclude that only substances with relatively constant river concentrations can be quantified accurately in the field by passive sampling if substance-specific Rs are determined. For that purpose, the proposed in-situ calibration is a very robust method and the substance specific Rs can be used in future monitoring studies in rivers with similar environmental conditions (i.e., flow velocity, temperature, pH).},

	abstract = {A new passive sampler was designed and characterized for the determination of free copper ion (Cu(2+)) concentration in aqueous solution. Each sampling device was composed of a set of about 30 diffusive milligel (DMG) beads. Milligel beads with incorporated cation exchange resin (Chelex) particles were synthetized using an adapted droplet-based millifluidic process. Beads were assumed to be prolate spheroids, with a diameter of 1.6 mm and an anisotropic factor of 1.4. The milligel was controlled in chemical composition of hydrogel (monomer, cross-linker, initiator and Chelex concentration) and characterized in pore size. Two types of sampling devices were developed containing 7.5\% and 15\% of Chelex, respectively, and 6 nm pore size. The kinetic curves obtained demonstrated the accumulation of copper in the DMG according to the process described in the literature as absorption (and/or adsorption) and release following the Fick's first law of diffusion. For their use in water monitoring, the typical physico-chemical characteristics of the samplers, i.e. the mass-transfer coefficient (k0) and the sampler-water partition coefficient (Ksw), were determined based on a static exposure design. In order to determine the copper concentration in the samplers after their exposure, a method using DMG bead digestion combined to Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was developed and optimized. The DMG devices proved to be capable to absorb free copper ions from an aqueous solution, which could be accurately quantified with a mean recovery of 99\% and a repeatability of 7\% (mean relative uncertainty).},

	abstract = {Fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) is a new, yet very promising member of the sorbent-based sorptive microextraction family. It has simultaneously improved both the extraction sensitivity and the speed of the extraction by incorporating high volume of sol-gel hybrid inorganic-organic sorbents into permeable fabric substrates. The advantages of FPSE have been investigated for the determination of four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and diclofenac, in environmental water samples in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Initially, the significance of several parameters affecting FPSE: sorbent chemistry, matrix pH and ionic strength were investigated using a mixed level factorial design (3(1)x2(2)). Then, other important parameters e.g., sample volume, extraction kinetics, desorption time and volume were also carefully studied and optimized. Due to the high sorbent loading on the FPSE substrate in the form of ultra-thin coating and the open geometry of the microextraction device, higher mass transfer of the target analytes occurs at a faster rate, leading to high enrichment factors in a relatively short period of time (equilibrium times: 45-100 min). Under optimal operational conditions, the limits of detection (S/N=3) were found to be in the range of 0.8 ng L(-1) to 5 ng L(-1). The enrichment factors ranged from 162 to 418 with absolute extraction efficiencies varied from 27 to 70\%, and a good trueness (82-116\% relative recoveries) indicating that the proposed method can be readily deployed to routine environmental pollution monitoring. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of target analytes in two influent and effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant and two river water samples in Spain.},

	abstract = {Higher capture efficiency in heterogeneous immunosensors is desirable for the detection of cancer biomarkers at low concentrations. The process of the capture of these antigens is transport limited since the rates of antigen/antibody reactions are faster. In the case of non-flow systems, diffusive transport has contributions from both translational and rotational phenomena. Since the contribution of the rotational diffusivity is comparatively less explored in the literature, we have studied the same for three antigens - bovine serum albumin (BSA), prostate specific antigen (PSA) and C-reactive proteins (CRP). We quantified the rotational diffusivities using the time resolved fluorescence anisotropy method, and further quantified the contribution of the rotational diffusivities to the overall diffusivity of the antigens, and also studied the effect of the process parameters - temperature and pH of the solution. With an increase in temperature, the rotational diffusivity increased showing Arrhenius dependence while with the variation of pH, it showed a non-monotonic behavior having maxima closer to the isoelectric point of the corresponding antigens. This interesting behavior of the pH values could be attributed to lesser electro-viscous effects when the antigen molecule is neutral around its isoelectric point. The optimization of the pH and temperature for the immunosensors could be utilized to design efficient immunosensors.},

Simulations showed that betaCD and Phe monomers could associate together to construct two distinctive assemblies, i.e, betaCD1-Phe1 and betaCD2-Phe1, respectively. The membrane-involved equilibrium simulations and the data of potential of mean forces (PMFs) further confirmed that Phe monomer was capable of penetrating through the membranes without confronting any large energy barrier, whereas, the single betaCD and betaCD-involved assemblies were unable to pass across the membranes. These observations clearly suggested that betaCD only served as the carrier to enhance the bioavailability of Phe rather than the co-substrate in the Phe biodegradation process. The Phe-separation PMF profiles indicated that the maximum of the Phe uptake by bacteria would be achieved by the "optimal" betaCD:Phe molar ratio, which facilitated the maximal formation of betaCD1-Phe1 inclusion and the minimal construction of betaCD2-Phe1 complex.},

We focus our attention on adsorbed protein monolayers upon a solid surface using a thermodynamic and kinetic analytical development. Account is also taken of the effects on the overall rate of the conformational change on a solid surface of deviation from ideality, of protein flexibility, of surface free energy and of interaction with reactive solid sites. Our theory applied to steady states is illustrated by examples such as folding-misfolding-unfolding of RNase and SNase on a solid surface after diffusion and adsorption from an aqueous solution. For this purpose, we put forward the determining steps which shall lead to the steady state. The existence of three situations is highlighted according to the values of the typical constants relevant for the protein considered: reaction rate determining step, diffusion and sorption determining steps, mixed adsorption diffusion and reaction rate. Finally, we have tried to link the developments of our theories to a large literature based on experimental results encountered during proteins diffusion-sorption-reaction processes, fundamental topics that has been since long investigated by Miller's team in MPKG.},

	abstract = {Aptamers and SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technology have gained increasing attention over the past 25 years. Despite their functional similarity to protein antibodies, oligonucleotide aptamers have many unique properties that are suitable for clinical applications and industrialization. Aptamers may be superior to antibodies in fields such as biomarker discovery, in vitro and in vivo diagnosis, precisely controlled drug release, and targeted therapy. However, aptamer commercialization has not occurred as quickly as expected, and few aptamer-based products have yet successfully entered clinical and industrial use. Thus, it is important to critically review some technical barriers of aptamer and SELEX technology per se that may impede aptamer development and application. To date, how to rapidly obtain aptamers with superior bioavailability over antibodies remains the key issue. In this review, we discuss different chemical and structural modification strategies aimed to enhance aptamer bioavailability. We also discuss improvements to SELEX process steps to shorten the selection period and improve the SELEX process success rate. Applications in which aptamers are particularly suited and perform differently or superior to antibodies are briefly introduced.},

MIP beads have been synthesized using COC as a template molecule, ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) as a functional monomer, divinylbenzene (DVB) as a cross-linker, and 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. High performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been used for quantifying the analytes after MIP-mu-SPE. Variables such as urine pH, adsorption temperature and time, mechanical (orbital-horizontal) stirring; and composition of the eluting solution and eluting time, were evaluated. The proposed method was shown to be precise and accurate [relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra- and inter-day tests ranging from 3 to 8\% and from 2 to 10\%, respectively]; and analytical recoveries in the range of 89-100\%). In addition, excellent accuracy was also verified after analyzing a FDT +25\% control material for BZE. The detection limits were in the range of 0.16-1.7 ng L(-1), low enough for confirmative conclusions regarding cocaine abuse. The method was finally applied for screening/quantifying cocaine and metabolites in urine samples from poly-drug abusers.},

Sensitive and rapid recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) detection tools that improve on the current laborious EPO detection techniques are in high demand for both clinical and sports industry. A sensitive aptamer-functionalized biosensor (aptasensor) has been developed by controlled growth of gold nanostructures (AuNS) over a gold substrate (pAu/AuNS). The aptasensor selectively binds to rHuEPO and, therefore, was used to extract and detect the drug from horse plasma by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Due to the nanogap separation between the nanostructures, the high population and distribution of hot spots on the pAu/AuNS substrate surface, strong signal enhancement was acquired. By using wide area illumination (WAI) setting for the Raman detection, a low RSD of 4.92\% over 150 SERS measurements was achieved. The significant reproducibility of the new biosensor addresses the serious problem of SERS signal inconsistency that hampers the use of the technique in the field. The WAI setting is compatible with handheld Raman devices. Therefore, the new aptasensor can be used for the selective extraction of rHuEPO from biological fluids and subsequently screened with handheld Raman spectrometer for SERS based in-field protein detection.},

	abstract = {Understanding the transfer of chemicals between passive samplers and water is essential for their use as monitoring devices of organic contaminants in surface waters. By applying Fick's second law to diffusion through the polymer and an aqueous boundary layer, the authors derived a mathematical model for the uptake of chemicals into a passive sampler from water, in finite and infinite bath conditions. The finite bath model performed well when applied to laboratory observations of sorption into polyethylene (PE) sheets for various chemicals (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT]) and at varying turbulence levels. The authors used the infinite bath model to infer fractional equilibration of PCB and DDT analytes in field-deployed PE, and the results were nearly identical to those obtained using the sampling rate model. However, further comparison of the model and the sampling rate model revealed that the exchange of chemicals was inconsistent with the sampling rate model for partially or fully membrane-controlled transfer, which would be expected in turbulent conditions or when targeting compounds with small polymer diffusivities and small partition coefficients (e.g., phenols, some pesticides, and others). The model can be applied to other polymers besides PE as well as other chemicals and in any transfer regime (membrane, mixed, or water boundary layer-controlled). Lastly, the authors illustrate practical applications of this model such as improving passive sampler design and understanding the kinetics of passive dosing experiments.

	abstract = {Single-phase passive samplers are gaining acceptance as a method to measure hydrophobic organic contaminant (HOC) concentration in water. Although the relationship between the HOC concentration in water and passive sampler is linear at equilibrium, mass transfer models are needed for nonequilibrium conditions. We report measurements of organochlorine pesticide diffusion and partition coefficients with respect to polyethylene (PE), and present a Fickian approach to modeling HOC uptake by PE in aqueous systems. The model is an analytic solution to Fick's second law applied through an aqueous diffusive boundary layer and a polyethylene layer. Comparisons of the model with existing methods indicate agreement at appropriate boundary conditions. Laboratory release experiments on the organochlorine pesticides DDT, DDE, DDD, and chlordane in well-mixed slurries support the model's applicability to aqueous systems. In general, the advantage of the model is its application in the cases of well-agitated systems, low values of polyethylene-water partioning coefficients, thick polyethylene relative to the boundary layer thickness, and/or short exposure times. Another significant advantage is the ability to estimate, or at least bound, the needed exposure time to reach a desired CPE without empirical model inputs. A further finding of this work is that polyethylene diffusivity does not vary by transport direction through the sampler thickness.},

	abstract = {Affinity-based controlled release modulates the delivery of protein or small molecule therapeutics through transient dissociation/association. To understand which parameters can be used to tune release, we used a mathematical model based on simple binding kinetics. A comprehensive asymptotic analysis revealed three characteristic regimes for therapeutic release from affinity-based systems. These regimes can be controlled by diffusion or unbinding kinetics, and can exhibit release over either a single stage or two stages. This analysis fundamentally changes the way we think of controlling release from affinity-based systems and thereby explains some of the discrepancies in the literature on which parameters influence affinity-based release. The rate of protein release from affinity-based systems is determined by the balance of diffusion of the therapeutic agent through the hydrogel and the dissociation kinetics of the affinity pair. Equations for tuning protein release rate by altering the strength (KD) of the affinity interaction, the concentration of binding ligand in the system, the rate of dissociation (koff) of the complex, and the hydrogel size and geometry, are provided. We validated our model by collapsing the model simulations and the experimental data from a recently described affinity release system, to a single master curve. Importantly, this mathematical analysis can be applied to any single species affinity-based system to determine the parameters required for a desired release profile.},

Comparing to the traditional kinetic calibration method, where the time constant was obtained from the extraction time profile, the new calibration approach shows improved accuracy and precision. More importantly, deuterated standards are not required in the new method, thus significantly improving its cost-effectiveness and extending its applicability to a wide range of analytes lack of deuterated analogs serving as internal standards. In addition, mass spectrometry is not necessary for the quantification of analytes with the new calibration method, which may further extend the applicability of PE-HF-LPME to some laboratories without mass spectrometers. This study has been substantiated with both theoretical and experimental evidences. Further, the feasibility of the method for real biological samples was demonstrated by measuring the free concentration of flunitrazepam in urine and plasma samples and its drug-protein binding ratio in plasma. The results showed that the method had a short analysis time and was easily implemented with high accuracy and good reproducibility.},

Adulterated (n = 46) and authentic (n = 36) beefburger samples were produced based on formulations derived using market knowledge and an experimental design. Raman spectral data in the fingerprint range (900-1800 cm(-1)) were examined using both a classification (partial least-squares discriminant analysis, PLS-DA) and class-modeling (soft independent modeling of class analogy, SIMCA) approach to identify offal-adulterated and authentic beefburgers. PLS-DA models correctly classified 89-100\% of authentic and 90-100\% of adulterated samples. SIMCA models were developed using either PCA or PLS scores as input data. For authentic beefburgers, they exhibited sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency values of 0.94-1, 0.64-1, and 0.80-0.97, respectively. PLS regression quantitative models were also developed in an attempt to quantify total offal and added fat in these samples. The performance of PLS regression quantitative models for prediction of added fat may be acceptable for screening purposes, with the most accurate model producing a coefficient of determination in prediction of 0.85 and a root-mean-square error of prediction equal to 3.8\% w/w.},

	abstract = {Availability of magnesium is a matter of concern due to its role in many environmental and biological processes. Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) devices can measure Mg availability in situ. This work shows that Mg accumulation in water largely increases when ionic strength (I) decreases. This phenomenon can be explained from (i) the increase of both the association equilibrium (K) and rate (ka,R) constants for the reaction between Mg cations and resin sites, and (ii) the growing contribution of the partitioning of Mg cations at the resin-gel interface, as I decreases. Two theoretical models that take into account electrical interactions among Mg cations, background electrolyte, and resin sites can successfully be used to determine ka,R and K at each I. Both models yield similar ka,R values, which fulfill an expression for the kinetic salt effect. For freshwater (with a typical salinity of 10 mM and circumneutral pH), the binding of Mg is so fast and strong that the simplest perfect-sink DGT expression can be helpful to predict (overestimation lower than 5\%) the accumulation in solutions with Mg concentrations up to 1 mM whenever the deployment time is below 9 h. Perfect sink conditions can still be applied for longer times, in systems with either a lower I or a lower Mg concentration.},

In this review, spontaneous, coherent and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies and imaging, as well as the fundamental principles governing the successful use of these techniques, are discussed. Methods for spectral data analysis are also highlighted. Utilization of the discussed Raman techniques for the detection and diagnosis of cancer in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo is described.

	abstract = {An overlooked issue for field application of in situ performance reference compound (PRC) calibration methods is the validity of the assumption that both the sorption of a target compound and desorption of its corresponding PRC follow the first-order kinetics with the same rate constants under stagnant conditions. In the present study, disposable polydimethylsiloxane fibers of 2 sizes (7 and 35 microm) impregnated with 8 (13) C-labeled or deuterated PRCs were statically deployed into different marine sediments, from which the kinetics for sorption of the target compounds and desorption of the PRCs were characterized. Nonsymmetrical profiles were observed for exchange of the target analytes and their corresponding PRCs in sediment under stagnant conditions. The hysteretic desorption of PRCs in the kinetic regime may be ascribed to the low chemical potential between the fiber and sediment porewater, which reflects the inability of water molecules to rapidly diffuse through sediment to solvate the PRCs in the aqueous layer around the fiber surface. A moderate correlation (r = 0.77 and r = 0.57, p {\textless} 0.05 for both regressions) between the PRC-calibrated equilibrium concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153 and the lipid normalized levels in worms (Neanthes arenaceodentata) was obtained in co-exposure tests under simulating field conditions, probably resulting from slightly overestimated bioavailability because of the hysteretic desorption of PRCs and toxic effects.

	abstract = {Three configurations of single-phase polymer passive samplers made of polyoxymethylene (POM), silicone rubber, and polyethylene (PE) were simultaneously calibrated in laboratory experiments by determining their partitioning coefficients and the POM diffusion coefficients and by validating a kinetic accumulation model. In addition, the performance of each device was evaluated under field conditions. With the support of the developed model, the device properties are discussed with regard to material selection and polymer thickness. The results show that a sampler's properties, such as its concentration-averaging period and ability to sample a large amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are widely affected by material selection. Sampler thickness also allows modulation of the properties of the device but with a much lower magnitude. Selection of the appropriate polymer and/or thickness allows samplers to be adapted either for quick equilibration or for the kinetic accumulation regime and promotes either membrane or water boundary layer control of the kinetic accumulation. In addition, membrane-controlled or equilibrated compounds are quantified with greater accuracy because they are not corrected by the performance reference compounds approach. However, the averaged concentrations cannot be assessed when compounds reach equilibrium in the sampler, whereas membrane-controlled devices remaining in the kinetic accumulation regime provide averaged concentrations without requiring performance reference compound correction; detection limits are then increased because of the higher mass transfer resistance of the membrane.

	abstract = {The effects of bivalve (Corbicula fluminea) bioturbation on the lability of phosphorus (P) in sediments were investigated. The high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were employed to obtain soluble and labile P/Fe profiles at a vertical resolution of 2 and 1mm, respectively. The bivalve bioturbation increased the concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP) in pore water and DGT-labile P up to 116\% and 833\% of the control within the sediment depths from the sediment water interface (SWI) to -64 mm and -44 mm, respectively. The sediments with bioturbation had a smaller distribution coefficient than the control (1964 vs. 3010 cm(3) g(-1)), reflecting a weaker ability in retaining P. Meanwhile, the sediments with bioturbation had a greater ratio of the concentration of DGT-labile P to that of SRP (0.20 vs. 0.03), demonstrating a stronger ability to resupply pore water SRP by the sediment solids when they are affected by the bioturbation. The DGT-induced fluxes in sediments (DIFS) modeling further showed a much shorter response time (277.9 vs. 18,670 s) and a much higher rate (0.192 vs. 0.002 day(-1)) of the solids in release of P with the bioturbation. Correspondingly, the flux of P to the overlying water from the bioturbation treatment increased up to 157\% of the control. The bivalve bioturbation significantly increased the concentrations of soluble Fe(II) and DGT-labile Fe up to 84\% and 334\% of the control from the SWI to -46 mm, respectively. The SRP and DGT-labile P were highly correlated with respective soluble and DGT-labile Fe. It was concluded that the release of P from the sediments with bioturbation to the pore water and the overlying water was promoted by the reductive dissolution of easily reducible Fe(oxyhydr)oxides due to the depletion of oxygen in the top sediments from bivalve respiration.},

	abstract = {Aquatic environments are often contaminated with complex mixtures of chemicals that may pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. This contamination cannot be addressed with target analysis alone but tools are required to reduce this complexity and identify those chemicals that might cause adverse effects. Effect-directed analysis (EDA) is designed to meet this challenge and faces increasing interest in water and sediment quality monitoring. Thus, the present paper summarizes current experience with the EDA approach and the tools required, and provides practical advice on their application. The paper highlights the need for proper problem formulation and gives general advice for study design. As the EDA approach is directed by toxicity, basic principles for the selection of bioassays are given as well as a comprehensive compilation of appropriate assays, including their strengths and weaknesses. A specific focus is given to strategies for sampling, extraction and bioassay dosing since they strongly impact prioritization of toxicants in EDA. Reduction of sample complexity mainly relies on fractionation procedures, which are discussed in this paper, including quality assurance and quality control. Automated combinations of fractionation, biotesting and chemical analysis using so-called hyphenated tools can enhance the throughput and might reduce the risk of artifacts in laboratory work. The key to determining the chemical structures causing effects is analytical toxicant identification. The latest approaches, tools, software and databases for target-, suspect and non-target screening as well as unknown identification are discussed together with analytical and toxicological confirmation approaches. A better understanding of optimal use and combination of EDA tools will help to design efficient and successful toxicant identification studies in the context of quality monitoring in multiply stressed environments.},

We measure 196 independent Raman spectra from 196 different points of one oral tissue sample and globally analyze these spectra using a Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) analysis. Discrimination of OSCC tissues is automatically and objectively made by spectral matching comparison of the MCR decomposed Raman spectra and the standard Raman spectrum of keratin, a well-established molecular marker of OSCC. We use a total of 24 tissue samples, 10 OSCC and 10 normal tissues from the same 10 patients, 3 OSCC and 1 normal tissues from different patients. Following the newly developed protocol presented here, we have been able to detect OSCC tissues with 77 to 92\% sensitivity (depending on how to define positivity) and 100\% specificity. The present approach lends itself to a reliable clinical diagnosis of OSCC substantiated by the "molecular fingerprint" of keratin.},

The development of specific enrichment techniques is the key to identify and quantify the low abundant proteins. Herein, a novel kind of aptamer functionalized hydrophilic polymer monolith was developed for the specific enrichment and detection of human alpha-thrombin from the human plasma. Human alpha-thrombin aptamer, with thiol group modified at the 5' terminal, was immobilized on the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate) monolithic column, with the binding capacity of 277.1mumol/L. Due to the hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate) as the cross-linking monomer, the detection recovery of the aptamer-functionalized hydrophilic polymer monolithic column could reach to 92.6+/-5.2\% (n=3) and the dynamic range could reach 0.5-300ng/muL (S/N{\textgreater}10) with on-line UV detection. Meanwhile, the column could run over 100 times, because the poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate) stability structure and the AuNPs improved the stability of the matrix material. Furthermore, this column could even capture the target alpha-thrombin, which was spiked in 1000 folds of original human plasma. All these results demonstrated the great potential of the prepared aptamer functionalized hydrophilic polymer monolith for the recognition of the trace proteins in the biological samples.},

The release and uptake kinetics of PCBs in quiescent sediment are reproduced by a 1-D diffusion model using sediment diffusion parameters fitted with the data from actual measurements. From the sediment diffusion parameters observed for uptake and release kinetics, it is seen that the uptake kinetics are distinctly slower than the release kinetics, most likely because of the sorption-desorption hysteresis of PCBs in the study sediment. Despite the presence of the anisotropic PCB exchange kinetics, a performance reference compound (PRC)-based method, which is grounded on the assumption of isotropic exchange kinetics, estimated the freely dissolved aqueous concentrations (Cfree) of PCBs in sediment pore-water with less than a factor of two error for the study sediment. The novel method developed in this study using PE with multiple thicknesses also gives reasonable estimates of Cfree, demonstrating its potential as another option for non-equilibrium passive sampling for hydrophobic organic contaminants in sediment pore-water.},

	abstract = {A novel diffusive sampler that combines radial and axial diffusion has been developed that improves upon existing commercially available designs. The POcket Diffusive (POD) sampler has been validated under laboratory and field conditions for the measurements of VOCs in ambient air. Laboratory tests varied sampling conditions of temperature (-30-40 C), humidity (10-80\%), wind velocity (0.1-4 m s(-1)), and concentration (0.5-50 mug m(-3)) for a number of specific VOCs. An overall uncertainty of circa 9\% for the measurement of benzene is calculated for the validation tests, in compliance with the data quality objectives of the EU air quality directive 2008/50/EC. A semi-empirical diffusion model has been developed to estimate sampling rates for compounds that were not tested, and for conditions outside of tested ranges during validation. The diffusion model (and validation tests) shows a low influence of environmental conditions on the sampling rate for the POD sampler. Average reproducibility values of circa 3\% are reported with overall sampling uncertainties ranging from 9\% to 15\%, for the whole range of tested conditions, depending on the compound. The adsorbent cartridge is compatible with existing thermal desorption systems in the market. The diffusive sampler can modify the sampling rate by changing the diffusive body within a range of different porosities. Field tests, conducted in parallel with independent quality controlled canister sampling, confirmed the ease of use and quality of VOC measurements with the POD sampler, for compounds that were, and were not, evaluated during laboratory tests.},

	abstract = {Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is a commonly-prescribed antibiotic that is largely excreted by the body, and is often found at elevated concentrations in treated sewage sludge (biosolids) at municipal wastewater treatment plants. When biosolids are applied to soils, they could release CIP to surface runoff, which could adversely affect growth of aquatic organisms that inhabit receiving water bodies. The hazard risk largely depends on the amount of antibiotic in the solid phase that can be released to solution (labile CIP), its diffusion coefficient, and sorption/desorption exchange rates in biosolids particles. In this study, these processes were evaluated in a Class A Exceptional Quality Biosolids using a diffusion gradient in thin films (DGT) sampler that continuously removed CIP from solution, which induced desorption and diffusion in biosolids. Mass accumulation of antibiotic in the sampler over time was fit by a diffusion transport and exchange model available in the software tool 2D-DIFS to derive the distribution coefficient of labile CIP (Kdl) and sorption/desorption rate constants in the biosolids. The Kdl was 13 mL g-1, which equated to 16\% of total CIP in the labile pool. Although the proportion of labile CIP was considerable, release rates to solution were constrained by slow desorption kinetics (desorption rate constant = 4 x 10-6 s-1) and diffusion rate (effective diffusion coefficient = 6 x 10-9 cm2 s-1. Studies are needed to investigate how changes in temperature, water content, pH and other physical and chemical characteristics can influence antibiotic release kinetics and availability and mobility in biosolid-amended soils.},

	abstract = {In this work, a durable and easy to handle thin film microextraction (TFME) device is reported. The membrane is comprised of poly(divinylbenzene) (DVB) resin particles suspended in a high-density polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) glue, which is spread onto a carbon fiber mesh. The currently presented membrane was shown to exhibit a substantially lesser amount of siloxane bleed during thermal desorption, while providing a statistically similar extraction efficiency toward a broad spectrum of analytes varying in polarity when compared to an unsupported DVB/PDMS membrane of similar shape and size which was prepared with previously published methods. With the use of hand-portable GC-TMS instrumentation, membranes cut with dimensions 40 mm long by 4.85 mm wide and 40 +/- 5 mum thick (per side) were shown to extract 21.2, 19.8, 18.5, 18,4, 26.8, and 23.7 times the amount of 2,4 dichlorophenol, 2,4,6 trichlorophenol, phorate D10, fonofos, chloropyrifos, and parathion, respectively, within 15 min from a 10 ppb aqueous solution as compared to a 65 mum DVB/PDMS solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. A portable high volume desorption module prototype was also evaluated and shown to be appropriate for the desorption of analytes with a volatility equal to or lesser than benzene when employed in conjunction with TFME membranes. Indeed, the coupling of these TFME devices to hand-portable gas chromatography toroidial ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-TMS) instrumentation was shown to push detection limits for these pesticides down to the hundreds of ppt levels, nearing that which can be achieved with benchtop instrumentation. Where these membranes can also be coupled to benchtop instrumentation it is reasonable to assume that detection limits could be pushed down even further. As a final proof of the concept, the first ever, entirely on-site TFME-GC-TMS analysis was performed at a construction impacted lake. Results had indicated the presence of contaminants such as toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate, which stood out from other naturally occurring compounds detected.},

	abstract = {In recent years, different geometrical configurations of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) have been directly coupled to mass spectrometry, resulting in benefits such as diminishing matrix effects, improvement of detection limits, and considerable enhancement of analysis throughput. Although SPME fibers have been used for years, their potential for quantitative analysis when directly combined with mass spectrometry has not been explored to its full extent. In this study, we present the direct coupling of biocompatible SPME (Bio-SPME) fibers to mass spectrometry via nanoelectrospray ionization (nano-ESI) emitters as a powerful tool for fast quantitative analysis of target analytes in biofluids. Total sample preparation time does not exceed 2 min, and by selecting an appropriate fiber length and sample vessel, sample volumes ranging between 10 and 1500 muL can be used. Despite the short extraction time of the technique, limits of detection in the subnanogram per milliliter with good accuracy ({\textgreater}/=90\%) and linearity (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.999) were attained for all the studied probes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), urine, and whole blood. Given that Bio-SPME-nano-ESI efficiently integrates sampling with analyte extraction/enrichment, sample cleanup (including elimination of matrix effects in the form of particles), and ionization, our results demonstrated that it is an advantageous configuration for bioanalytical applications such as therapeutic drug monitoring, doping in sports, and pharmacological studies in various matrixes.},

For reducing the sulfate background on the resin gels, photopolymerization was applied instead of ammonium persulfate-induced polymerization. Agarose cross-linked polyacrylamide (APA) hydrogels were used as diffusive layer. The sulfate diffusion coefficient in APA gel was determined as 9.83 x 10(-6) +/- 0.35 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) at 25 degrees C. The accumulated sulfate was eluted in 1 mol L(-1) HNO3 with a recovery of 90.9 +/- 1.6 \%. The developed method was tested against two standard extraction methods for soil sulfate measurement. The obtained low correlation coefficients indicate that DGT and conventional soil test methods assess differential soil sulfate pools, rendering DGT a potentially important tool for measuring labile soil sulfate.},

We account for the variability in wind speed, air temperature, and equilibrium partitioning over the course of the deployment of the samplers. The model, provided as an annotated Matlab script, predicts the Veff as a function of physical-chemical properties of each compound and meteorology from the closest Integrated Surface Database (ISD) data set obtained through NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The model was developed to be user-friendly, only requiring basic Matlab knowledge. To illustrate the effectiveness of the model, we evaluated three independent data sets of airborne PCBs simultaneously collected using passive and active samplers: at sites in Chicago, Lancaster, UK, and Toronto, Canada. The model provides Veff values comparable to those using depuration compounds and calibration against active samplers, yielding an average congener specific concentration method ratio (active/passive) of 1.1 +/- 1.2. We applied the model to PUF-PAS samples collected in Chicago and show that previous methods can underestimate concentrations of PCBs by up to 40\%, especially for long deployments, deployments conducted under warming conditions, and compounds with log Koa values less than 8.},

	abstract = {Household air pollution is ranked the 9(th) largest Global Burden of Disease risk (Forouzanfar et al., The Lancet 2015). People, particularly urban dwellers, typically spend over 90\% of their daily time indoors, where levels of air pollution often surpass those of outdoor environments. Indoor air quality (IAQ) standards and approaches for assessment and control of indoor air require measurements of pollutant concentrations and thermal comfort using conventional instruments. However, the outcomes of such measurements are usually averages over long integrated time periods, which become available after the exposure has already occurred. Moreover, conventional monitoring is generally incapable of addressing temporal and spatial heterogeneity of indoor air pollution, or providing information on peak exposures that occur when specific indoor sources are in operation. This article provides a review of new air pollution sensing methods to determine IAQ and discusses how real-time sensing could bring a paradigm shift in controlling the concentration of key air pollutants in billions of urban houses worldwide. We also show that besides the opportunities, challenges still remain in terms of maturing technologies, or data mining and their interpretation. Moreover, we discuss further research and essential development needed to close gaps between what is available today and needed tomorrow. In particular, we demonstrate that awareness of IAQ risks and availability of appropriate regulation are lagging behind the technologies.},

	abstract = {This study reports the design and evaluation of a new synthetic receptor sensor based on the amalgamation of biomolecular recognition elements and molecular imprinting to overcome some of the challenges faced by conventional protein imprinting. A thiolated DNA aptamer with established affinity for prostate specific antigen (PSA) was complexed with PSA prior to being immobilised on the surface of a gold electrode. Controlled electropolymerisation of dopamine around the complex served to both entrap the complex, holding the aptamer in, or near to, it's binding conformation, and to localise the PSA binding sites at the sensor surface. Following removal of PSA, it was proposed that the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) cavity would act synergistically with the embedded aptamer to form a hybrid receptor (apta-MIP), displaying recognition properties superior to that of aptamer alone. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate subsequent rebinding of PSA to the apta-MIP surface. The apta-MIP sensor showed high sensitivity with a linear response from 100pg/ml to 100ng/ml of PSA and a limit of detection of 1pg/ml, which was three-fold higher than aptamer alone sensor for PSA. Furthermore, the sensor demonstrated low cross-reactivity with a homologous protein (human Kallikrein 2) and low response to human serum albumin (HSA), suggesting possible resilience to the non-specific binding of serum proteins.},

Risk modeling of W transport and fate in the environment relies on measurement of the release/mobilization flux of W in the bulk media and the interfaces between matrix compartments. Diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) is a promising passive sampling technique to acquire such information. DGT devices equipped with the newly developed high-resolution binding gels (precipitated zirconia, PZ, or ferrihydrite, PF, gels) or classic/conventional ferrihydrite slurry gel were comprehensively assessed for measuring W in waters. (Ferrihydrite)DGT can measure W at various ionic strengths (0.001-0.5molL(-1) NaNO3) and pH (4-8), while (PZ)DGT can operate across slightly wider environmental conditions. The three DGT configurations gave comparable results for soil W measurement, showing that typically W resupply is relatively poorly sustained. 1D and 2D high-resolution W profiling across sediment-water and hotspot-bulk media interfaces from Lake Taihu were obtained using (PZ)DGT coupled with laser ablation ICP-MS measurement, and the apparent diffusion fluxes across the interfaces were calculated using a numerical model.},

They are generally obtained through an iterative SELEX protocol that enriches a population of synthetic oligonucleotides to a subset that can recognize the chosen target molecule specifically and avidly. A wide range of targets is recognized by aptamers. Once identified and optimized for performance, aptamers can be reproducibly synthesized and offer other key features, like small size, low cost, sensitivity, specificity, rapid response, stability, and reusability. This makes them excellent options for sensory units in a variety of analytical platforms including those with electrochemical, optical, and mass sensitive transduction detection. Many novel sensing strategies have been developed by rational design to take advantage of the tendency of aptamers to undergo conformational changes upon target/analyte binding and employing the principles of base complementarity that can drive the nucleic acid structure. Despite their many advantages over antibodies, surprisingly few aptamers have yet been integrated into commercially available analytical devices. In this review, we discuss how to select and engineer aptamers for their identified application(s), some of the challenges faced in developing aptamers for analytics and many examples of their reported successful performance as sensors in a variety of analytical platforms.},

The detection process of human whole blood can be totally automated in this integrated microfluidic system. According to the experimental results, when compared to conventional bench-top manual assays, reagent consumption was significantly reduced by 75\%, and the analysis time was reduced from 3.5h to 30 min. Besides, the novelty in this research also lies in the simultaneously performed two parallel assays for detection of Hb and HbA1c in a single chip. Therefore, this sensitive and low-cost aptamer-based microfluidic system may become a promising tool for point-of -care diagnosis of diabetes.},

	abstract = {A nanomaterials-based DGT device constructed with commercial dialysis membrane as diffusive layer and nanoparticulate Fe3O4 aqueous suspension as binding phase is developed and validated for in situ aquatic arsenic measurement. The Fe3O4NPs binding phase is capable of quantitatively accumulated both As(III) and As(V) species. As(III) and As(V) species coexist in the vast majority of environmental water samples. The large difference in diffusion coefficients of As(III) (DAs(III)=3.05x10(-7)cm(2)s(-1)) and As(V) (DAs(V)=1.63x10(-7)cm(2)s(-1)) makes the accurate DGT determination of total arsenic concentration of samples containing both species difficult. An effective diffusion coefficient (DAs =DAs(III)[1/(1+x)]+DAs(V)[x/(1+x)],where,x=As(V)/As(III)) approach is therefore proposed and validated for accurate DGT determination of total arsenic when As(III) and As(V) coexist. The experimental results demonstrate that for samples having As(V)/As(III) ratios between 0.1 and 0.9, the DGT determined total arsenic concentrations using DAs are within +/-93-99\% of that determined by ICP-MS. The general principle demonstrated in this work opens up a new avenue of utilizing functional nanomaterials as DGT binding phase, paving a way for developing new generation nanomaterials-based DGT devices that can be readily produced in massive numbers at low costs, facilitating the widespread use of DGT for large-scale environmental assessment and other applications.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their oxygenated analogues (OPAHs) are ubiquitous air pollutants known to cause adverse health effects. PAH air levels are commonly monitored by active sampling but passive sampling has become popular because of its lower cost and simplicity, which facilitate long-term sampling and increased spatial coverage. However, passive samplers are less suitable for short-term sampling and are in general less accurate than active samplers because they require reliable sampling rate (Rs) measurements for individual analytes under diverse environmental conditions. In this study a small passive sampler designed to sample both particle-bound and gaseous compounds was evaluated and calibrated for PAHs and OPAHs in a traffic environment by co-deployment with active samplers for two weeks. Despite the relatively low average air concentrations of PM10 (20 mug/m(3)), PM2.5 (5 mug/m(3)), total PAHs (4.2 ng/m(3)), and OPAHs (2.3 ng/m(3)) at the site, detectable quantities (on average 24 times above blank values) of the full range of PAHs and OPAHs were captured, with low variability (average RSD of 16\%). This was accomplished by using a Tenax((R)) TA-modified glass fiber substrate that is compatible with highly sensitive thermal desorption GC-MS analysis, which made it possible to achieve detection limits per sample in the pg range. Experiments with inverted samplers revealed that the relative contribution of gravitational settling to the sampling of particles carrying PAHs and OPAHs was around 3.5 times larger than other deposition mechanisms. Average Rs values for individual OPAHs and PAHs were 0.046 +/- 0.03 m(3)/day and 0.12 +/- 0.07 m(3)/day, respectively, with no appreciable difference between the values for particle-associated and gaseous compounds. Furthermore, the Rs values were competitive with other currently used passive samplers if normalized for substrate area. Overall, the new sampler's performance, simplicity and ability to generate relatively time-resolved data make it a promising candidate for diverse SVOC monitoring studies.},

A laser-enabled, micromoulding technique was then used to fabricate 3x3 microneedle arrays, each individual microneedle having triangular, square or hexagonal base geometries. Their penetration characteristics into ex-vivo porcine skin, were investigated for the first time by CT scan imaging. This revealed greater penetration depths for the triangular and square-based microneedles, demonstrating CT scan as a powerful and reliable technique for studying microneedle skin penetration.},

Here, we demonstrate the use of Raman spectroscopy to discriminate normal lymphocytic B-cells from three different B-leukemia transformed cell lines (i.e., RS4;11, REH, MN60 cells) based on their biochemical features. In combination with immunofluorescence and Western blotting, we show that these Raman markers reflect the relative changes in the potential biological markers from cell surface antigens, cytoplasmic proteins, and DNA content and correlate with the lymphoblastic B-cell maturation/differentiation stages. Our study demonstrates the potential of this technique for classification of B-leukemia cells into the different differentiation/maturation stages, as well as for the identification of key biochemical changes under chemotherapeutic treatments. Finally, preliminary results from clinical samples indicate high consistency of, and potential applications for, this Raman spectroscopy approach.},

We evaluated Diffusive Milli-Gels (DMG), a new in situ passive sampler, for assessing the bioavailability and toxicity of copper in waters exhibiting a wide range of characteristics. The performance was compared to an established Chelex-column method that measures labile copper concentrations by discrete sampling, and the ability to predict acute toxicity to the cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia. The labile copper concentrations measured by the DMG and Chelex-column methods decreased with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (1.9-15 mg L-1) and hardness (21-270 mg CaCO3 L-1 hardness), with 20-70\% of total dissolved copper being present as labile copper. Toxicity decreased with increasing DOC and hardness. Strong linear relationships existed between the EC50 for C. dubia and DOC, and when the EC50 was related to either the labile copper concentrations measured by DMG (r2 = 0.874) or the Chelex column (0.956) methods. The study demonstrates that the DMG passive sampler is a relevant tool for the in situ assessment of environmental risks posed by metals whose toxicity is strongly influenced by speciation.},

	abstract = {Higher capture efficiency of biomarkers in heterogeneous immunosensors would enable early detection of diseases. Several strategies are used to improve the capture efficiency of these immunosensors including the geometry of the system along with the transport and reaction parameters. Having a prior knowledge of the behavior of the above parameters would facilitate the design of an efficient immunosensor. While the contributions of the transport and reaction parameters toward understanding of the mechanism involved in capture have been well studied in the literature, their effect in combination with the geometry of the sensors has not been explored until now. In this work, we have experimentally demonstrated that the capture efficiency of the antigen-antibody systems is inversely related to the size of the sensor patch. The experimental system was simulated in order to get an in-depth understanding of the mechanism behind the experimental observation. Further, the extent of heterogeneity in the system was analyzed using the Sips isotherm to obtain the heterogeneity index (alpha) and the reaction rate constant (K(D)) as fitted parameters for a sensor patch of 1.5 mm radius. The experimental kinetic data obtained for the same sensor patch matched reasonably with the simulation results by considering K(D) as the global affinity constant, which indicated that our system can be considered to be homogeneous. Our simulation results associated with the size dependency of the capture efficiency were in agreement with the trends obtained in our experimental observations where an inverse relation was observed owing to the fact that the mass-transfer limitation decreases with the decrease in the size of the sensor patch. The possible underlying mechanism associated with size dependency of capture efficiency was discussed based on the time-dependent radial variation of captured antigens obtained from our simulation results. A study on the parametric variation was further conducted for the nonmixed and mixed systems on the transport (Deff), reaction (K(D)), and geometric parameters (R). Two different correlations were established for the nonmixed and mixed systems between the capture efficiency (f) and a nondimensional number (t(D)/t(R)) consisting of the above-mentioned parameters. Such unified relations will be useful in designing heterogeneous immunosensors and can be extended to microfluidic immunosensors.},

	abstract = {In this work a series of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to predict the deposition of particles on a newly designed passive dry deposition (Pas-DD) sampler. The sampler uses a parallel plate design and a conventional polyurethane foam (PUF) disk as the deposition surface. The deposition of particles with sizes between 0.5 and 10 mum was investigated for two different geometries of the Pas-DD sampler for different wind speeds and various angles of attack. To evaluate the mean flow field, the k-varepsilon turbulence model was used and turbulent fluctuating velocities were generated using the discrete random walk (DRW) model. The CFD software ANSYS-FLUENT was used for performing the numerical simulations. It was found that the deposition velocity increased with particle size or wind speed. The modeled deposition velocities were in general agreement with the experimental measurements and they increased when flow entered the sampler with a non-zero angle of attack. The particle-size dependent deposition velocity was also dependent on the geometry of the leading edge of the sampler; deposition velocities were more dependent on particle size and wind speeds for the sampler without the bend in the leading edge of the deposition plate, compared to a flat plate design. Foam roughness was also found to have a small impact on particle deposition.},

	abstract = {It is of great significance to accurately and reliably detect trace lead(II) (Pb(2+)) ions, preferably at sub-nM level due to the possible long-term accumulation of Pb(2+) in the human body, which may cause serious threats to human health. However, a suitable Pb(2+) sensor meeting the demands is still scanty. Herein, we develop a polyadenine-assisted, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) silicon chip (0.5 cm x 0.5 cm) composed of core (Ag)-satellite (Au) nanoparticles (Ag-Au NPs)-decorated silicon wafers (Ag-Au NPs@Si) for high-performance Pb(2+) detection. Typically, strong SERS signals could be measured when DNAzyme conjugated on the SERS silicon chip is specifically activated by Pb(2+), cleaving the substrate strand into two free DNA strands. A good linearity exists between the normalized Raman intensities and the logarithmic concentrations of Pb(2+) ranging from 10 pM to 1 muM with a good correlation coefficient, R(2) of 0.997. Remarkably, Pb(2+) ions with a low concentration of 8.9 x 10(-12) M can be readily determined via the SERS silicon chip ascribed to its superior SERS enhancement, much lower than those ( approximately nM) reported by other SERS sensors. Additionally, the developed chip features good selectivity and recyclability (e.g., approximately 11.1\% loss of Raman intensity after three cycles). More importantly, the as-prepared chip can be used for accurate and reliable determination of unknown Pb(2+) ions in real systems including lake water, tap water and industrial wastewater, with the RSD value less than 12\%.},

Stir bar/water partition coefficients were measured by equilibrating bars with sheets made of silicone rubber material for which partition coefficients had been reported previously. Kinetic parameters characterising the exchange of analytes between stir bars and water were determined under controlled exposure conditions using a passive dosing system. The dosing system consisted of silicone rubber sheets with a large surface area, spiked with analytes. During stir bar sampler exposure, analytes partitioned from dosing sheets to water in the exposure tank and maintained constant exposure concentrations. Reversible and isotropic exchange kinetics of analytes between sampler and water was confirmed by measuring the release of a range of performance reference compounds (PRCs) from stir bars. Application of a two-resistance model confirmed that, except for hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, uptake of the test compounds under the experimental conditions was controlled by diffusion in the water boundary layer. This permits the application of PRCs for in situ calibration of uptake kinetics of test compounds to stir bars.},

In this study, we first introduce the fundamentals of mass transfer and then present a series of representative works from the past two decades, focusing on the most recent years. These works cover: (i) predicting and controlling emissions from indoor sources, (ii) determining concentrations of indoor air pollutants, (iii) estimating dermal exposure for some indoor gas-phase SVOCs, and (iv) optimizing air-purifying approaches. The mass transfer analysis spans the micro-, meso-, and macroscales and includes normal mass transfer modeling, inverse problem solving, and dimensionless analysis. These representative works have reported some novel approaches to mass transfer. Additionally, new dimensionless parameters such as the Little number and the normalized volume of clean air being completely cleaned in a given time period were proposed to better describe the general process characteristics in emissions and control of airborne organic compounds in the indoor environment. Finally, important problems that need further study are presented, reflecting the authors' perspective on the research opportunities in this area.},

Kinetic parameter-T C (33-56,060 s), distribution coefficient-K d (134.7-1536 cm(3)g(-1)), and resupply parameter-R (0.189-0.743) are derived by DGT measurement, the sediment/pore water test, and the DIFS model.

Based on parameter and curves derived by the DIFS model, the P release-transfer character and mechanism in sediment microzone were revealed. Moreover, the DGT-DIFS parameters (R, T C , K -1 , C DGT ), sediment P pool, sediment properties (Al and Ca), and soluble reactive P (SRP) in overlying water can be used to assess "P eutrophication level" at different sampling sites with different types of "external P loading."

	abstract = {The success of in vivo solid phase microextraction (SPME) depends significantly on the selection of calibration method. Three kinetic in vivo SPME calibration methods are evaluated in this paper: (1) on-fibre standardization (OFS), (2) dominant pre-equilibrium desorption (DPED), and (3) the diffusion-based interface (DBI) model. These are compared in terms of precision, accuracy, and ease of experimental use by employing a flow device simulating an animal circulatory system. In addition, the kinetic calibration methods were validated against established SPME equilibrium extraction (EE) external calibration and a conventional sample preparation method involving protein precipitation. The comparison was performed using a hydrophilic drug fenoterol as the analyte of interest. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was used for the determinations. All three kinetic methods compared well with both EE extraction and the conventional method in terms of accuracy (93–119\%). In terms of precision, the DBI model had the best precision in whole blood and buffered phosphate saline solution with \%RSD similar to the standard techniques (9–15\%). DPED had the poorest precision of \%RSD (20–30\%) possibly due to errors associated with uncertainty in the amount of standard loaded on-fibre and remaining on the fibre after desorption. In addition, incurred errors could result due to the greater number of fibres used in comparison to the other two calibration methods. The precision of the OFS procedure was better than for DPED primarily because the use of multiple fibres is eliminated. In terms of the ease of use for calibration, the DBI model was the simplest and most convenient as it did not require standards once it had been calibrated or the uptake constant was calculated. This research suggests the potential use of DBI model as the best kinetic calibration method for future in-vein blood SPME investigations.},

However, the calibration of PE-SPME is often time-consuming and requires deuterated calibrants, which if available, are often expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a simple but versatile kinetic calibration method, in which nonisotopic (label-free) compounds of interest can supplant the use of deuterated analogues, and the need to determine partitioning coefficients inherent to earlier procedures has been eliminated. Using this approach, both free and total concentrations of analytes can be simultaneously measured within complex sample systems with high accuracy and precision. This calibration method was validated against established E-SPME and solid-phase extraction techniques through the measurement of selected pharmaceuticals in progressively complex matrixes including inorganic buffers, fish blood, and municipal wastewater effluents. This calibration approach may significantly improve time and cost-effectiveness, while improving the application of the SPME approach within highly dynamic systems.},

The off-flavor compounds are due to the absorption of substances produced by a range of microorganisms. Currently, a number of strategies have been used to prevent or limit the growth of these microorganisms. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies via monitoring the concentrations of off-flavor compounds in the recirculating aquaculture system. In vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME), a rapid and simple sample preparation method, will allow monitoring the concentration of off-flavor compounds in live fish. In this research, geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) produced by cyanobacteria and actinomycetes, which are the major sources for “earthy” and “muddy” flavors in fish, were selected as representatives. In order to accurately quantify these compounds in fish muscle, two kinetic calibration methods, on-fiber standardization and measurement using predetermined sampling rate, were used as quantification methods, which were both validated by traditional methods. The detection limit of in vivo SPME in fish muscle was 0.12 ng/g for geosmin and 0.21 ng/g for 2-MIB, which are both below the human sensory thresholds.},

	abstract = {Most sample-enrichment procedures currently available rely on adsorption of the analytes of interest by a suitable adsorbent material. Although good performance can be obtained for many practical problems, in some cases the applicability of adsorptive sample preparation falls short, particularly for the enrichment of polar and/or high-molecular-weight compounds, especially in combination with thermal desorption. Because of the very strong retention of adsorbent materials, undesired effects such as incomplete desorption and artifact formation are observed. Polar solutes are easily adsorbed but readily undergo surface-catalyzed reactions and on desorption yield compounds different than those originally sampled. High-molecular-weight compounds cannot be desorbed because of extremely strong interactions with the adsorbent and their low volatility. To overcome some of these problems sample-preparation techniques based on polydimethylsiloxane sorption have been developed over the past 15 years. In contrast with adsorptive trapping, sorption is based on dissolution of the analytes in a liquid polymeric material. This is a much more inert means of solute retention which overcomes some of the limitations encountered when working with adsorbents. In this contribution, the basic principles of sorption, the different instrumentation used, and applications of the technique will be reviewed. The review covers the sorptive sample-preparation techniques, open-tubular trapping (OTT), solid-phase microextraction (SPME), gum-phase extraction (GPE), equilibrium gum-phase extraction (EGPE), and stir-bar-sorptive extraction (SBSE). Because of the nature of sorptive sample-preparation techniques, which perform particularly well in combination with thermal desorption, this review focuses strongly on gas chromatography as the means of chemical analysis.},

A dynamic air dilution system with syringe pumps generated the vapor concentrations and humidity for the exposure chamber. The O-oxime derivatives were desorbed with hexane for gas chromatographic analysis on a nonpolar capillary column and electron capture detection. The pellet capacity was about 30 micromoles. Adsorption of valeraldehyde was best fitted by a Langmuir or Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) I model. That for acrolein was described best by a Dubinin-Radushkevich model. A microporosity model explained why all the classical isotherms described the chemisorption behavior. An activated extrinsic precursor was suggested to facilitate the addition reaction by production of a protonated intermediate formed by the transfer of a proton to the aldehyde from an activated reaction site consisting of at least 2 PFBHA molecules.},

	abstract = {Uptake of nutrients by cultured cells on solid supports, conversion of substrates by surface-bound catalysts and binding of antibodies to microtitre plates are examples of transport processes that are strongly influenced by the flow conditions in the surrounding fluid. The literature on this subject is scattered over widely different research fields and is often found in dated, and not generally available, treatises. Also, the subject is inherently complicated from a mathematical viewpoint, because even the simplest experimental configurations will usually not allow analytical solutions for the diffusion-convection equations describing the solute mass transport in the system. Fortunately, however, relatively simple expressions for the rates of mass transport can often be obtained in physically realistic limiting cases. The present study attempts to give a short overview of the main experimental models used in this field and presents simple equations for the estimation of solute exchange rates between surfaces and fluids. The models considered are: (1) uptake from an unstirred solution; (2) reversible binding from a perfectly stirred solution; (3) reversible binding through an unstirred fluid layer; (4) catalytic conversion at the internal surface of a tube or a slit with laminar flow; (5) adsorption by a surface opposite a rotating stirrer; (6) adsorption from an impinging fluid jet; and (7) uptake by the surface of a rotating disc. In practical situations the property of uniform accessibility proves to be of crucial importance. Stirring by ultrasound, more specifically the use of acoustic streaming in nano-devices, is also discussed.},

Time evolutions of the concentration of one species are given, both in solution and on the microchannel walls. The model illustrates the adsorption limitation sometimes observed when the microdimensions of these systems induce a global depletion of the bulk solution. A new non-dimensional parameter is introduced to predict the final value of the coverage of any microsystem under static adsorption. A working curve and a criteria (h/K[Gamma](max) {\textgreater} 10) are provided in order to choose, for given adsorption characteristics, the value of the volume-to-surface ratio (i.e. the channel height h) avoiding depletion effects on the coverage (relative coverage greater than 90\% of the theoretical one). Simulations were compared with confocal microscopy measurements of IgG antibody adsorption on the walls of a PET microchannel. The fit of the model to the experimental data show that the adsorption is under apparent kinetic control.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of the partition process to solid phase microextraction fibres is often modelled using a stagnant layer model. Despite its usefulness, in some agitation systems such a model cannot be applied because the stagnant layer cannot be characterized precisely. Therefore, in this present study an alternative approach is introduced. Transport from the bulk medium to the fibre coating is simply modelled by a finite mass transfer coefficient instead of diffusion through a stagnant water layer surrounding the fibre. Intra-fibre transport is described by non-steady diffusion. The model is aimed at the analysis of SPME measurements in the kinetic phase for samples including a binding matrix. It was validated with experimental results of SPME measurements concerning the absorption kinetics of [(3)H]estradiol at different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a chemical binding matrix. The model provides excellent fits of the experimental data, resulting in an association constant (K(a)) of estradiol for BSA of 5.66 x 10(4) M(-1), which is similar to literature values and a fibre coating/bulk medium partition coefficient of 5.0 x 10(3). The kinetics of extraction were studied with the model, showing that the rate-limiting step in the extraction process was the diffusion in the fibre. This finding rules out the possibility that the presence of the matrix itself in the diffusion layer affects the kinetics of estradiol uptake into the SPME fibre.},

	abstract = {A technique is proposed to enhance microfluidic immuno-sensors, for example, immunoassays, in which a ligand immobilized on a microchannel wall specifically binds analyte flowing through the channel. These sensors can be limited in both response time and sensitivity by the diffusion of analyte to the sensing surface. In certain applications, the sensitivity and response of these heterogeneous immunoassays may be improved by using AC electrokinetically-driven microscale fluid motion to enhance antigen motion towards immobilized ligands. Specifically, the electrothermal effect is used to micro-stir analyte near the binding surface. Numerical simulations of antigen in a microchannel flow subjected to the electrothermal effect show that 6 V(rms) applied to electrodes near a binding region can increase binding in the first few minutes by a factor of seven. The effectiveness of electrothermal stirring is a strong function of the Damkohler number. The greatest binding enhancement is possible for high Damkohler numbers, where the reaction is limited by diffusion. Based on these results, the utility of this technique for diffusion-limited microfluidic sensor applications is demonstrated.},

Two types of SPME fibers and six sampling-related factors were chosen and nested in an L(18) Taguchi's orthogonal array. Samples were thermally desorpted and analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector (GC/ECD). The use of 85-mum Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (Car/PDMS) fibers resulted in greater adsorbed mass, which was highly correlated with the product of concentration and sampling time (r{\textgreater}0.99, p{\textless}0.0001), than 85-microm polyacrylate fibers. The sampling rate (SR) of the 85-microm Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibers was not significantly affected by variations in relative humidity (0-80\%) and coexistent toluene (none to 100 ppm). Variance of sampling rate was predominantly attributed to the diffusive path length (86.4\%) and sampling time (5.7\%). With diffusive paths of 3, 10 and 15 mm, the sampling rates of 85-microm Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibers for methylene chloride were 1.4 x 10(-2), 7.7 x 10(-3) and 5.1 x1 0(-3)mL min(-1), respectively. The measured sampling rates were greater than the theoretical values, and decreased with increment of sampling time until they came to constant.},

However, a systematic quantitative experimental evaluation of the microspot kinetics is still missing in the literature. Our work aims at filling this important gap of knowledge on the example of antigen binding to antibody microspots. A mathematical model was derived within the framework of two-compartment model and applied to the quantitative analysis of the experimental data obtained for typical antibody microspot assays. A strong mass-transport dependence of the antigen-antibody microspot kinetics was identified to be one of the main restrictions of this new technology. The binding reactions are slowed down in the microspot immunoassays by several orders of magnitude as compared with the corresponding well-stirred bulk reactions. The task to relax the mass-transport limitations should thus be one of the most important issues in designing the antibody microarrays. These limitations notwithstanding, the detection range of more than five orders of magnitude and the high sensitivity in the low femtomolar range were experimentally achieved in our study, demonstrating thus an enormous potential of this highly capable technology.},

	abstract = {We study theoretically the transport and kinetic processes underlying the operation of a biosensor (particularly the surface plasmon sensor "Biacore") used to study the surface binding kinetics of biomolecules in solution to immobilized receptors. Unlike previous studies, we concentrate mainly on the modeling of system-specific phenomena rather than on the influence of mass transport limitations on the intrinsic kinetic rate constants determined from binding data. In the first problem, the case of two-site binding where each receptor unit on the surface can accommodate two analyte molecules on two different sites is considered. One analyte molecule always binds first to a specific site. Subsequently, the second analyte molecule can bind to the adjacent unoccupied site. In the second problem, two different analytes compete for one binding site on the same surface receptor. Finally, the third problem considers the case of positive cooperativity among bound molecules in the hydrogel using a simple mean-field approach. The transport in both the flow channel and the hydrogel phases of the biosensor is taken into account in this case (with few exceptions, most previous studies assume a simpler model in which the hydrogel is treated as a planar surface with the receptors). We consider simultaneously diffusion and convection through the flow channel together with diffusion and cooperativity binding on the surface and in the hydrogel. In each case, typical results for the concentration contours of the free and bound molecules in the flow channel and hydrogel regions are presented together with the time-dependent association/dissociation curves and reaction rates. For binding site competition, the analysis predicts overshoot phenomena.},

Biofouling densities on the sampler surface ranged from 0.3 to 16g dry weight dm(-2). Water sampling rates were estimated from the dissipation rates of performance reference compounds (PRCs). The antifouling agents Irgarol and capsaicin (33 mg per ml triolein) had no noticeable effect on the extent of fouling, and caused only a 5-10\% increase in the absorbed amounts. Enhanced flow rates had only a minimal effect on the amount of biofouling, but caused the water sampling rates to increase by a factor of 1.2-2. Increases in PRC-derived sampling rates were reflected by increases in the absorbed amounts for compounds that were in the linear uptake stage of the sampling process. The results imply (1) that extreme biofouling does not always result in reduced sampling rates, (2) that extreme biofouling does not preclude the existence of flow effects on the sampling rates, and (3) that differences in uptake rates are quantitatively reflected by the dissipation rates of PRCs.},

	abstract = {We report on the development of solid phase microextraction probes for drug analysis, prepared with antibodies specific for benzodiazepines covalently immobilized to the surface. In the technique, immobilized antibody probes are exposed to a sample containing the drug for 30 min. Extracted drugs are subsequently desorbed from the probes in 500 microL of methanolic desorption solution, which is dried, reconstituted in a small volume of injection solution and analysed by LC-MS/MS. The antibodies were characterized both before and after immobilization, to facilitate the rational selection of antibodies for such analyses. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were compared as was the impact of affinity purification of the polyclonal antibody to isolate the drug-specific fraction. The probes were evaluated for utility in analyzing 7-aminoflunitrazepam at sub ng/mL concentrations in urine, which is expected to be found several days after a single oral dose of 2 mg of flunitrazepam. Such analyses are required in monitoring for abuse of this drug, both in terms of 'club drug' use and in cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault. In these cases drug concentrations in blood and urine are much lower than in chronic abuse cases and are difficult to analyse by conventional methods. The method developed has a limit of detection of 0.02 ng/mL, with accuracy ranging from 1\% to 27\% and precision (\% R.S.D.) ranging from 2\% to 10\% between the lower and upper limits of quantitation for the analysis of 7-aminoflunitrazepam in urine. The dynamic range of the method is from 0.02 ng/mL, which is limited by the instrument sensitivity, to 0.5 ng/mL, which is approaching the capacity of the probes. This would allow for quantitative analysis of samples at concentrations below that measurable by many other methods for general benzodiazepines analysis from urine, and a highly selective screen for samples at higher concentrations. The method has similar limits of detection to the most sensitive literature methods specifically designed for such analysis but with the advantage of significantly simplified sample preparation. This simplification makes the technique more amenable for use by both professionals and non-professionals.},

	abstract = {The plasma protein binding of drugs has been shown to have significant effects on the quantitative relationship between clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In many clinical situations, measurement of the total drug concentration does not provide the needed information concerning the unbound fraction of drug in plasma, which is available for pharmacodynamic action. Therefore, the accurate determination of unbound plasma drug concentrations is important in understanding drug action. Many methodologies exist for determining the extent of plasma protein binding, but different methods produce a rather wide range of results for the same compound at the same concentration level. The solid phase microextraction (SPME) method reported in the present study attempts to eliminate many experimental variables that could lead to the lack of reproducibility, such as the variable content of organic solvent or ionic strength in plasma, pH shifts, and volume shifts. Five well-known drugs were chosen to study plasma protein binding: ibuprofen, warfarin, verapamil, propranolol, and caffeine, with high, intermediate and low binding properties. Dilution of plasma with isotonic PBS or incubation with 10\% CO(2) in the atmosphere was found to compensate for changes in pH during incubation. The data obtained using these pH-controlled methods correlate well with the average values of plasma protein binding found in the literature. SPME, which uses an extraction phase that dissolves or adsorbs the drug of interest and rejects proteins, overcomes several limitations of currently available techniques and is a thermodynamically sound method, since the measurements are always performed at equilibrium. Compared to other methods, SPME offers several advantages: small sample size, short analysis time, possibility to automate, and ability to directly study complex samples.},

The on-rod standardization technique was applied to the PDMS rod passive sampler. Using the desorption of the pre-loaded standard on the PDMS rod to calibrate the absorption of the target analytes allows for the determination of the time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of pollutants in the aqueous media. The PDMS rod passive sampler with the on-rod standardization technique was tested in the laboratory with a flow-through system and was subsequently applied to measure TWA concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the field (Hamilton Harbour, Hamilton, Ont., Canada). Both the laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that, with the on-rod standardization technique, the PDMS rod can be successfully used as a passive sampler for TWA water sampling in the field. The PDMS rod passive sampler benefits from the inherent advantages of the SPME approach: it incorporates sampling, isolation and enrichment into one step. The design of this system also addressed the additional needs for passive sampling techniques, providing an economical approach to field sampling that is also easy to deploy. Rather, with this approach, TWA concentrations of target analytes can be obtained by one sampler, and can be analyzed directly, with no further sample preparation treatment required.},

The overall analyte capture efficiency is a crucial measure of the ultimate sensitivity of such devices, and a detailed kinetic analysis tells us how rapidly such measurements may be made. We have analyzed the capture kinetics under a variety of conditions, including the possibility of so-called surface-enhanced ligand capture. One of the modalities studied requires ligand capture through a cross-linking mechanism, and it was found that this mode may provide a robust and sensitive approach to biomolecular detection. For the two modalities studied, we find that detection of specific biomolecules down to concentration levels of 1 nM or less appear to be quite feasible for the device configurations studied.},

The effect of temperature and water turbulence on kinetic and thermodynamic parameters characterising the exchange of analytes between the sampler and water was studied in a flow-through system under controlled conditions. It was found that the absorption of test analytes from water to the sampler is related to their desorption to water. This allows for the in situ calibration of the uptake of pollutants using offload kinetics of performance reference compounds. The sampling kinetics are dependent on temperature, and for most of the tested analytes also on the flow velocity. Sampler-water partition coefficients did not significantly change with temperature.},

In addition if no sample depletion occurs, the bound drug-free drug equilibria are not disturbed. In the present study seven pharmaceuticals (quinine, quinidine, naproxen, ciprofloxacin, haloperidol, paclitaxel and nortriptyline) were assayed by SPME. For quantitative purposes SPME was validated first in the absence of proteins. Calibration curves were constructed for each drug by HPLC-fluorescence and HPLC-UV analysis. SPME was combined to HPLC off-line, desorption occurring in HPLC inserts filled with 200 microL methanol. Binding of each drug to human serum albumin was studied independently. Experimental results were in agreement with literature data and ultrafiltration experiments, indicating the feasibility of the method for such bioanalytical purposes.},

Its success is therefore empirically associated with effective delivery of potent therapeutics to the target site at a therapeutic concentration, for a sufficient time, and in a biologically active form. However, local delivery with drug-eluting stents imparts large dynamic concentration gradients across tissues that can be difficult to identify, characterize and control. This review explores the factors such as physiological transport forces, drug physicochemical properties, local biological tissue properties and stent design that governs the local pharmacokinetics within the arterial wall by drug-eluting stent. Rational design and optimization of drug-eluting stents for local delivery thus requires a careful consideration of all these factors.},

These nanofibrous membranes contain reactive groups which can be used to covalently immobilize biomacromolecules. Two natural macromolecules, chitosan and gelatin, were tethered on these nanofibrous membranes to fabricate dual-layer biomimetic supports for enzyme immobilization in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxyl succinimide (NHS). Lipase from Candida rugosa was then immobilized on these dual-layer biomimetic supports using glutaraldehyde (GA), and on the nascent PANCMA fibrous membrane using EDC/NHS as coupling agent, respectively. The properties of the immobilized lipases were assayed. It was found that there is an increase of the activity retention of the immobilized lipase on the chitosan-modified nanofibrous membrane (45.6+/-1.8\%) and on the gelatin-modified one (49.7+/-1.8\%), compared to that on the nascent one (37.6+/-1.8\%). The kinetic parameters of the free and immobilized lipases, K(m) and V(max), were also assayed. In comparison with the immobilized lipase on the nascent nanofibrous membrane, there is an increase of the V(max) value for the immobilized lipases on the chitosan- and gelatin-modified nanofibrous membranes. Results also indicate that the pH and thermal stabilities of lipases increase upon immobilization. The residual activities of the immobilized lipases are 55\% on the chitosan-modified nanofibrous membrane and 60\% on the gelatin-modified one, after 10 uses.},

The efficacy and toxicity of these local therapeutics depend upon arterial drug deposition, distribution, and retention. To examine how administered dose and drug release kinetics control arterial drug uptake, a model was created using principles of computational fluid dynamics and transient drug diffusion-convection. The modeling predictions for drug elution were validated using empiric data from stented porcine coronary arteries. Inefficient, minimal arterial drug deposition was predicted when a bolus of drug was released and depleted within seconds. Month-long stent-based drug release efficiently delivered nearly continuous drug levels, but the slow rate of drug presentation limited arterial drug uptake. Uptake was only maximized when the rates of drug release and absorption matched, which occurred for hour-long drug release. Of the two possible means for increasing the amount of drug on the stent, modulation of drug concentration potently impacts the magnitude of arterial drug deposition, while changes in coating drug mass affect duration of release. We demonstrate the importance of drug release kinetics and administered drug dose in governing arterial drug uptake and suggest novel drug delivery strategies for controlling spatio-temporal arterial drug distribution.},

Polymer comparison included four critical properties: release of oligomers, swelling in solvents (dichloromethane, hexane, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol), contaminant diffusion coefficients and partition coefficients for naphthalene, fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. Amounts of extracted oligomers ranged from 2\% to 4\% for SRs and LDPE, to about 1\% for EXACT. No oligomer release was observed for POM. Diffusion coefficients were higher in all SRs compared with LDPE and EXACT. No measurable diffusion was observed in POM after 24h of exposure. Differences in polymer-water partition coefficients spanned two orders of magnitude, with the lowest values observed for POM and the highest values observed for LDPE and EXACT. For the ten tested SRs, this range was less than 0.4 log units. Transport resistances estimated on the basis of diffusion coefficients and partition coefficients were generally lower for SRs than for LDPE and EXACT.},

These assays suffer from numerous performance limitations, including sensitivity and rapidity. Assay miniaturization is advocated to improve surface-capture performance, specifically exploiting the inverse relationship between analyte flux and capture feature size under mass transfer-limiting capture conditions that characterize many such assay formats. Reduced capture feature sizes, e.g., microarrays, are proposed to overcome mass transfer limitations, yet this is difficult to achieve across several size scales. This study validates certain advantages advocated for capture spot miniaturization using a rationale to understand surface capture miniaturization strategies. Experimentally derived immobilized ligand and target capture densities as a function of microspot size for DNA oligomers immobilized on model gold substrates are compared directly with theoretical analysis, validating the hypothesis that miniaturization yields many practical assay advantages. Specifically, results show that transitions from assay mass transfer limiting to kinetically limiting conditions as feature size decreases identify an optimal microspot size range for a specific bioassay system. Analytical advantages realized from such assay miniaturization are more uniform target-spot coverage and substantially increased rate of capture (hybridization), increasing assay signal and rapidity.},

	abstract = {Binding of pyrene (PyH) and its derivatives to humic acid (HA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The nature of the interaction between HA and pyrene derivatives are extensively investigated by employing three derivatives ranging from anionic to cationic compounds: 1-pyrenebutylic acid (PyA), 1-pyrenemethanol (PyM), and 1-pyrenebutyltrimethylammonium bromide (PyB). Binding constants between HA and PyX (X=H, A, M, B) are obtained by steady-state fluorescence quenching techniques, and it is found that PyB has a markedly large binding constant among the pyrene family. This is attributed to a strong electrostatic interaction between cationic PyB and anionic HA. The result suggests that an electrostatic interaction plays a dominant role in binding of pyrenes to humic acid. The importance of electrostatic interaction was also confirmed by a salt effect on the binding constant. Influence of collisional quenching on the binding constant, which causes overestimation of the binding constant, was examined by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy as well as temperature effect in steady-state fluorescence measurements. It is elucidated that collisional quenching does not much bring overestimation into the binding constants.},

For partition coefficients (K(sw)) much larger than unity and a sufficiently thin polymer film, the concentration gradient of the analyte in the polymer phase is largely insignificant. The growth of the accumulated amount of analyte is then adequately described by the well-known exponential expression for steady-state diffusion under non-depletive conditions, provided the initial transient stage is properly taken into account. In case of fiber-type solid phases, the cylindrical nature of the diffusion complicates the nature of the transient stage as well as the magnitude of the steady-state flux.},

	abstract = {In this review we examine various methods for the immobilization of aptamers onto different substrates that can be utilized in a diverse array of analytical formats. In most cases, covalent linking to surfaces is preferred over physisorption, which is reflected in the bulk of the reports covered within this review. Conjugation of aptamers with appropriate linkers directly to gold films or particles is discussed first, followed by methods for conjugating aptamers to functionally modified surfaces. In many aptamer-based applications, silicates and silicon oxide surfaces provide an advantage over metallic substrates, and generally require surface modification prior to covalent attachment of the aptamers. Chemical protocols for covalent attachment of aptamers to functionalized surfaces are summarized in the review, showing common pathways employed for aptamer immobilization on different surfaces. Biocoatings, such as avidin or one of its derivatives, have been shown to be highly successful for immobilizing biotin-tethered aptamers on various surfaces (e.g., gold, silicates, polymers). There are also a few examples reported of aptamer immobilization on other novel substrates, such as quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and carbohydrates. This review covers the literature on aptamer immobilization up to March 2007, including comparison of different linkers of varying size and chemical structure, 3' versus 5' attachment, and regeneration methods of aptamers on surfaces.},

	abstract = {Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthetic polymers having a predetermined selectivity for a given analyte, or group of structurally related compounds, that make them ideal materials to be used in separation processes. In this sense, during past years a huge amount of papers have been published dealing with the use of MIPs as sorbents in solid-phase extraction, namely molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE). Although the majority of these papers were restricted to describe the use of different templates for different applications, several attempts proposing new alternatives to minimize the inherent drawbacks of the preparation and use of MIPs (i.e. template bleeding, tedious synthesis procedure, etc.) have been reported. Thus, this paper does not pretend to be a collection of MISPE-related papers but to give an overview on the significant attempts carried out during recent years to improve the performance of MIPs in solid-phase extraction. In addition, the use of MIPs packed in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns for the direct injection of crude sample extracts and the preparation of imprinted fibres for solid-phase microextraction will be also discussed.},

	abstract = {Biosorption has been defined as the property of certain biomolecules (or types of biomass) to bind and concentrate selected ions or other molecules from aqueous solutions. As opposed to a much more complex phenomenon of bioaccumulation based on active metabolic transport, biosorption by dead biomass (or by some molecules and/or their active groups) is passive and based mainly on the "affinity" between the (bio-)sorbent and sorbate. A personal overview of the field and its origins is given here, focusing on R\&D reasoning and know-how that is not normally published in the scientific literature. While biosorption of heavy metals has become a popular environmentally driven research topic, it represents only one particular type of a concentration-removal aspect of the sorption process. The methodology of studying biosorption is based on an interdisciplinary approach to it, whereby the phenomenon can be studied, examined and analyzed from different angles and perspectives-by chemists, (micro-)biologists as well as (process) engineers. A pragmatic science approach directs us towards the ultimate application of the phenomenon when reasonably well understood. Considering the variety of parameters affecting the biosorption performance, we have to avoid the endless empirical and, indeed, alchemistic approach to elucidating and optimizing the phenomenon-and this is where the power of computers becomes most useful. This is all still in the domain of science-or "directed curiosity". When the knowledge of biosorption is adequate, it is time to use it-applications of certain types of biosorption are on the horizon, inviting the "new technology" enterprise ventures and presenting new and quite different challenges.},

Here we describe the design and application of a short DNA molecule capable of both protein target binding and amplifiable bioreadout processes. Because both recognition and readout capabilities are incorporated into a single DNA molecule, tedious conjugation procedures required for protein-DNA hybrids can be omitted. The DNA aptamer is designed to be amplified directly by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rolling circle amplification (RCA) processes, taking advantage of real-time amplification monitoring techniques for target detection. A combination of both RCA and PCR provides a wide protein target dynamic range (1 microM to 10 pM).},

In this study, the exchange kinetics were modelled to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of the accumulation process and to enable the measurement of TWA concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants in the field. An empirical relationship that enables the calculation of in situ sampling rates of chemicals using performance reference compounds was derived and its application was demonstrated in a field study in which TWA aqueous concentrations estimated from sampler data for target analytes were compared with TWA concentrations obtained from spot samples of water collected regularly during the sampler deployment period.},

The aim of this study was to suggest the SPME method as an alternative to conventional techniques used in the evaluation of worker exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). Polymethylsiloxane-carboxen (PDMS/CAR) showed as the most effective stationary phase material for sorbing BTEX among other materials (polyacrylate, PDMS, PDMS/divinylbenzene, Carbowax/divinylbenzene). Various experimental conditions were studied to apply SPME to BTEX quantitation in field situations. The uptake rate of the selected fiber (75 microm PDMS/CAR) was determined for each analyte at various concentrations, relative humidities, and airflow velocities from static (calm air) to dynamic ({\textgreater} 200 cm/s) conditions. The SPME method also was compared with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health method 1501. Unlike the latter, the SPME approach fulfills the new requirement for the threshold limit value-short term exposure limit (TLV-STEL) of 2.5 ppm for benzene (8 mg/m(3)).},

However, owing to competitive adsorption, quantification remains a challenging task. In this area, a theoretical model, based on Fick's laws and an extended Langmuir equation, is proposed to deal with the adsorption kinetics of acetone/toluene mixture on SPME fibre under various static extraction conditions. The semipredictive model is first used to determine the axial diffusion coefficients of analytes in the sampling device. The model is then tested with a complex VOC mixture, showing good agreement with experimental data.},

	abstract = {In this study, a new calibration method, standard-free kinetic calibration, is proposed for rapid on-site analysis by solid-phase microextraction (SPME), based on the diffusion-controlled mass transfer model and equilibrium extraction. With this calibration method, all analytes can be directly calibrated with only two samplings. The feasibility of this calibration method was validated in a standard aqueous solution flow-through system and a standard gas flow-through system. The distribution coefficients of five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, anthracene, and pyrene, between water and the PDMS fiber coating were determined and the concentrations of the PAHs in the flow-through system were successfully calibrated with the proposed standard-free calibration method. The extracted amounts of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbezene, o-xylene) at equilibrium were also successfully calibrated with this method with two rapid sampling periods at 5 and 10 s. Compared with the previous calibration methods for rapid on-site analysis by SPME, this method does not require a standard to calibrate the extraction, nor does it require additional equipment to control or measure the flow velocity of the sample matrix. In addition, all of the extracted analytes can be quantified without considering whether the system reached equilibrium. The newly proposed standard-free kinetic calibration approach enriched the calibration methods available for on-site analysis by SPME.},

An anti-D-adenosine aptamer was coupled, using an in-situ method, by way of an amide bond to macroporous carboxylic acid based silica. Frontal chromatography analysis was performed to evaluate the column properties, i.e., determination of the stationary phase binding capacity and the dissociation constant of the target-immobilized aptamer complex. It was found that such covalent immobilization was able to maintain the aptamer binding properties at a convenient level for an efficient enantioseparation. Subsequently, the separation of adenosine enantiomers was investigated under different operating conditions, including changes in the eluent's ionic strength and the proportion of organic modifiers as well as column temperatures. It was demonstrated that, under various conditions of use and storage, the present CSP was stable over time.},

	abstract = {Due to the significant advances in information technology mathematical modeling of drug delivery is a field of steadily increasing academic and industrial importance with an enormous future potential. The in silico optimization of novel drug delivery systems can be expected to significantly increase in accuracy and easiness of application. Analogous to other scientific disciplines, computer simulations are likely to become an integral part of future research and development in pharmaceutical technology. Mathematical programs can be expected to be routinely used to help optimizing the design of novel dosage forms. Good estimates for the required composition, geometry, dimensions and preparation procedure of various types of delivery systems will be available, taking into account the desired administration route, drug dose and release profile. Thus, the number of required experimental studies during product development can be significantly reduced, saving time and reducing costs. In addition, the quantitative analysis of the physical, chemical and potentially biological phenomena, which are involved in the control of drug release, offers another fundamental advantage: The underlying drug release mechanisms can be elucidated, which is not only of academic interest, but a pre-requisite for an efficient improvement of the safety of the pharmaco-treatments and for effective trouble-shooting during production. This article gives an overview on the current state of the art of mathematical modeling of drug delivery, including empirical/semi-empirical and mechanistic realistic models. Analytical as well as numerical solutions are described and various practical examples are given. One of the major challenges to be addressed in the future is the combination of mechanistic theories describing drug release out of the delivery systems with mathematical models quantifying the subsequent drug transport within the human body in a realistic way. Ideally, the effects of the design parameters of the dosage form on the resulting drug concentration time profiles at the site of action and the pharmacodynamic effects will become predictable.},

Yet rarely does an analysis of the interplay between diffusion, convection and reaction motivate experimental design or interpretation. Here we develop a physically intuitive and practical understanding of analyte transport for researchers who develop and employ biosensors based on surface capture. We explore the qualitatively distinct behaviors that result, develop rules of thumb to quickly determine how a given system will behave, and derive order-of-magnitude estimates for fundamental quantities of interest, such as fluxes, collection rates and equilibration times. We pay particular attention to collection limits for micro- and nanoscale sensors, and highlight unexplained discrepancies between reported values and theoretical limits.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing need to monitor concentrations of polar organic contaminants in the aquatic environment. Integrative passive samplers can be used to assess time weighted average aqueous concentrations, provided calibration data are available and sampling rates are known. The sampling rate depends on environmental factors, such as temperature and water flow rate. Here we introduce an apparatus to investigate the sampling properties of passive samplers using river-like flow conditions and ambient environmental matrices: river water and treated sewage effluent. As a model sampler we selected Empore SDB-RPS disks in a Chemcatcher housing. The disks were exposed for 1 to 8 days at flow rates between 0.03 and 0.4 m s(-1). Samples were analysed using a bioassay for estrogenic activity and by LC-MS-MS target analysis of the pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and clarithromycin. In order to assess sampling rates of SDB disks, we also measured aqueous concentrations of the pharmaceuticals. Sampling rates increased with increasing flow rate and this relationship was not affected by the environmental matrix. However, SDB disks were only sampling in the integrative mode at low flow rates {\textless}0.1 m s(-1) and/or for short sampling times. The duration of linear uptake was particularly short for sulfamethoxazole (1 day) and longer for clarithromycin (5 days). At 0.03 m s(-1) and 12-14 degrees C, the sampling rate of SDB disks was 0.09 L day(-1) for clarithromycin, 0.14 L day(-1) for sulfamethoxazole and 0.25 L day(-1) for carbamazepine. The results show that under controlled conditions, SDB disks can be effectively used as passive sampling devices.},

	abstract = {The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose by cellulases is one of the major steps involved in the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to yield biofuel. This hydrolysis by cellulases, a heterogeneous reaction, currently suffers from some major limitations, most importantly a dramatic rate slowdown at high degrees of conversion. To render the process economically viable, increases in hydrolysis rates and yields are necessary and require improvement both in enzymes (via protein engineering) and processing, i.e. optimization of reaction conditions, reactor design, enzyme and substrate cocktail compositions, enzyme recycling and recovery strategies. Advances in both areas in turn strongly depend on the progress in the accurate quantification of substrate-enzyme interactions and causes for the rate slowdown. The past five years have seen a significant increase in the number of studies on the kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. This review provides an overview of the models published thus far, classifies and tabulates these models, and presents an analysis of their basic assumptions. While the exact mechanism of cellulases on lignocellulosic biomass is not completely understood yet, models in the literature have elucidated various factors affecting the enzymatic rates and activities. Different assumptions regarding rate-limiting factors and basic substrate-enzyme interactions were employed to develop and validate these models. However, the models need to be further tested against additional experimental data to validate or disprove any underlying hypothesis. It should also provide better insight on additional parameters required in the case that more substrate and enzyme properties are to be included in a model.},

	abstract = {An automated ligand-receptor binding study was performed for the first time using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A new multi-fibre SPME system, which relies on multi-well plate technology and allows parallel preparation of up to 96 samples was used in order to obtain all data points of the binding curve in a single experiment. The binding of diazepam to human serum albumin was used as the model system in order to evaluate the performance of automated SPME. The time required to establish equilibrium was 30 min; this was verified experimentally by constructing extraction time profiles in the presence and absence of receptor molecules. Fibre constant calibration was used to remove inter-fibre variability from the binding data. Using a simple one-site binding model, a binding constant of 9.1 x 10(5)+/-3 x 10(5)l/mol was obtained. This result is in excellent agreement with values for equilibrium dialysis and manual SPME procedures reported in the literature. The proposed method can be further extended to study plasma-protein binding or drug binding to whole blood. In comparison to other methods, SPME is simpler, faster and fully automated, can be combined with any analytical detection method, and can be used to directly study complex samples.},

	abstract = {An in situ application of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) as a sampling and sample preparation method coupled to HPLC-MS/MS for direct monitoring of ochratoxin A (OTA) distribution at different locations in a single cheese piece is proposed. To be suited to the acidic analyte, the extraction phase (carbon-tape SPME fiber) was acidified with aqueous solution of HCl at pH 2, instead of the traditional sample pre-treatment with acids before SPME sampling. For calibration, kinetic on-fiber-standardization was used, which allowed the use of short sampling time (20 min) and accurate quantification of the OTA in the semi-solid cheese sample. In addition, the traditional kinetic calibration that used deuterated compounds as standards was extended to use a non-deuterated analogue ochratoxin B (OTB) as the standard of the analyte OTA, which was supported by both theoretical discussion and experimental verification. Finally, the miniaturized SPME fiber was adopted so that the concentration distribution of OTA in a small-sized cheese piece could be directly probed. The detection limit of the resulting SPME method in semi-solid gel was 1.5 ng/mL and the linear range was 3.5-500 ng/mL. The SPME-LC-MS/MS method showed good precision (RSD: approximately 10\%) and accuracy (relative recovery: 93\%) in the gel model. The direct cheese analysis showed comparable accuracy and precision to the established liquid extraction. As a result, the developed in situ SPME-LC-MS/MS method was sensitive, simple, accurate and applicable for the analysis of complicated lipid-rich samples such as cheese.},

It represents an interesting alternative to standard dynamic sampling protocol as it is easier to implement. If standard dynamic sampling determines emission rates, passive FLEC-SPME aims to the determination of the concentration in air at the material surface. That could be assumed provided that material/air equilibrium is reached. Thus, VOCs emission kinetics were studied for 3 different materials (pine wood panel, carpet and PVC floor) to determine equilibrium times. Then, the relevance of the method has been assessed using new materials through a 3-day emission test. Qualitative results were compared to those obtained from the standard method to check the ability of FLEC-SPME to detect the most toxic compounds, named "VOCs of interest" and listed in the French regulation. Minor differences were observed, so this methodology seems promising, especially for field studies aiming in the identification of VOCs sources in buildings. Moreover, the concentration at the material surface combined to emission modeling could be used to predict indoor VOCs concentrations helping in indoor air quality diagnostic.},

In this study for the first time the influence of microneedle geometry on the transport through the formed conduits was visualised in human volunteers by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Three differently shaped 300 mum long microneedle arrays were selected and fluorescein was applied either before or after piercing. Based on the intensity a distinction was made between regions with high and low intensity fluorescence (HIF and LIF). The areas of both intensities were quantified over time. In most cases HIF areas were only present in the stratum corneum, while LIF areas were also present in the viable epidermis. The areas were larger if fluorescein was applied after piercing compared to before piercing. After 15 min almost no HIF was present anymore at the skin surface. The microneedle geometry, but not the manner of application affected the shape and depth of the conduits. In conclusion we showed that the different microneedle arrays are able to form conduits in the skin, but the geometry of the microneedles influences the penetration of the fluorescent dye. This is the first step towards a more rational design of microneedle arrays for transcutaneous vaccination.},

The underlying theory is increasingly mature but is often based on the assumption of constant concentrations with time in the ambient fluid. This theoretical work details the passive sampler response to possible environmental situations in which ambient concentrations vary linearly with time, decrease exponentially with time, constitute a pulsed event, or oscillate regularly with time. The modeled shape of sampler response curve with time is characteristic and can be used to determine how fluid concentrations have changed with time. The sampler elimination rate constant is shown to be crucial in governing sampler response. Thus, by using performance reference compounds and under certain conditions, information from the sampler response can in theory be used to derive specific details of the temporal variation of the contaminant in the ambient fluid. For example, data captured by a passive sampler can be used to characterize a contamination pulse. This extends the versatility of passive samplers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: The behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in pore water of soils and sediments. Since partitioning to DOM reduces the bioavailable or freely dissolved PAH concentration in pore water, it is important to assess the effect of environmental variables on the magnitude of dissolved organic matter to water partition coefficients (K (DOC)). The objective of this study was to apply passive samplers to measure freely dissolved PAHs allowing depletion from the aqueous phase. The method was applied to determine K (DOC) at different temperatures for a selection of PAHs with natural DOM of very different origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Freely dissolved concentrations of (spiked) phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[e]pyrene were determined by exposing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibers to aqueous solutions containing DOM extracted from freshwater sediments from Finland and the Netherlands. The K (DOC) values were subsequently calculated at different temperatures (3.2, 20, and 36 degrees C) by including temperature-dependent PDMS to water partition coefficients (K (PDMS)) in a mass balance. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on partitioning of PAHs to PDMS fibers or DOM was assessed by comparing the enthalpy of sorption to the excess enthalpy of dissolution of liquid PAHs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Partitioning to DOM resulted in a decrease of freely dissolved concentrations with increasing DOM concentrations and a large range in log K (DOC) values at 20 degrees C for benzo[e]pyrene was observed (log K (DOC) = 4.93-6.60 L kg(-1) organic carbon). An increase of 10 degrees C in temperature resulted in a decrease of K (PDMS) by 0.09 to 0.13 log units for phenanthrene to pyrene and a decrease of K (DOC) by 0.13 log units for pyrene. The calculated enthalpies of sorption were less exothermic than the (negative) excess enthalpies of dissolution as expected for non-specific interactions between PAHs and PDMS or DOM. CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of PAHs in sedimentary pore waters can be accurately determined by application of PDMS fibers (without requiring negligible depletion) in the presence of natural DOM with different sorption affinity for PAHs. The observed natural variability in log K (DOC) values for different sediments shows that large differences can occur in freely dissolved PAH concentrations in pore water and properties of DOM should be taken into account in predicting the bioavailability of PAHs. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the partitioning behavior of PAHs shows that interactions between PAHs and environmental sorbents are comparable to interactions between PAHs in their pure condensed liquid phase and calculated excess enthalpies can be safely used to directly correct partition coefficients for temperature. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The application of PDMS fibers in measuring freely dissolved PAH concentrations can be used to study structural and thermodynamic aspects of PAH sorption to natural DOM as well as other environmental processes such as enhanced diffusion phenomena in pore water that are dependent on the amount (or concentration) of DOM, sorption affinity of DOM, and hydrophobicity of PAHs. These environmental factors will therefore give further insight into the site-specific exposure to freely dissolved PAH concentrations in soil and sedimentary pore water.},

	abstract = {The mass transfer rates and equilibrium partitioning behaviour of 14 diverse organochlorine pesticides (OCP) between water and polyethylene (PE) passive samplers, cut from custom made PE sheets and commercial polyethylene plastic bags, were quantified. Overall mass transfer coefficients, k(O), estimated PE membrane diffusion coefficients, D(PE), and PE-water partitioning coefficients, K(PE-water,) are reported. In addition, the partitioning of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from water to PE is quantified and compared with literature values. K(PE-water) values agreed mostly within a factor of two for both passive samplers and also with literature values for the reference PAHs. As PE is expected to exhibit similar sorption behaviour to long-chain alkanes, PE-water partitioning coefficients were compared to hexadecane-water partitioning coefficients estimated with the SPARC online calculator, COSMOtherm and a polyparameter linear free energy relationship based on the Abraham approach. The best correlation for all compounds tested was with COSMOtherm estimated hexadecane-water partitioning coefficients.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The advancement in material design and engineering has led to the rapid development of new materials with increasing complexity and functions. Both non-degradable and degradable polymers have found wide applications in the controlled delivery field. Studies on drug release kinetics provide important information into the function of material systems. To elucidate the detailed transport mechanism and the structure-function relationship of a material system, it is critical to bridge the gap between the macroscopic data and the transport behavior at the molecular level. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The structure and function information of selected non-degradable and degradable polymers have been collected and summarized from literature published after the 1990s. The release kinetics of selected drug compounds from various material systems is discussed in case studies. Recent progress in the mathematical models based on different transport mechanisms is highlighted. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This article aims to provide an overview of structure-function relationships of selected non-degradable and degradable polymers as drug delivery matrices. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Understanding the structure-function relationship of the material system is key to the successful design of a delivery system for a particular application. Moreover, developing complex polymeric matrices requires more robust mathematical models to elucidate the solute transport mechanisms.},

In this study, we evaluate the effect of sampler material on the passive sampling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in two Norwegian rivers. Low density polyethylene membranes (LDPE), silicone strips and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) with the exact same surface area and conformation were exposed in the Drammen River for overlapping exposures of 24 and 51 d, under identical hydrodynamic conditions. Dissipation rates of performance reference compounds (PRCs) spiked in all samplers were consistent and demonstrated no significant differences in sampler-water analyte exchange kinetics between the two exposures. The transition to fully boundary layer-controlled uptake shown by PRC dissipation rates was confirmed by investigating PAH masses absorbed by the samplers. Masses of analytes with log K(ow){\textgreater}4.5 absorbed into the samplers were similar and independent of the sampler material used, generally indicating for these compounds that the boundary layer dominated the resistance to mass transfer. The very low variability in analyte masses absorbed across sampler types observed here indicates that much of the overall variability in dissolved contaminant concentrations seen in passive sampler intercomparison studies is likely the result of the uncertainty associated with sampler-water partition coefficients and PRC dissipation rates. PRC dissipation rates and ratios of masses absorbed over 51 and 24 d for these compounds demonstrated integrative sampling over 51 d and no major effects of biofouling on sampling. The equivalence of data obtained using silicone strips and SPMDs supports the use of single-phase polymeric passive sampling devices.},

The goals were to better understand the principles of bioconcentration by aquatic organisms and to aid in the design of a convenient and simple chemical monitoring tool to replace the use of live animals. The worms and films were exposed simultaneously to the contaminated water stream. In the initial extraction stage, similar extracted amount per surface area indicated that thin-film samplers could mimic the behavior of worms for passive sampling. Equilibrium was reached faster by the thin films than by the worms. A good linear relationship between the bioconcentration factors and the film-water partition coefficients of PAHs was found, which demonstrated the feasibility of thin-film sampler for determining the bioavailability of PAHs in water. Compared to the lengthy and inconvenient process of liquid-liquid extraction in worm treatment, thin-film technique simplifies the sample pretreatment procedure by integrating sampling and sample preparation.},

However, relatively few studies investigate the binding kinetics on modified bead surfaces in a microfluidics context. In this study, a customized hot embossing technique is used to stamp microwells in a thin plastic substrate where streptavidin-coated agarose beads are selectively placed and subsequently immobilized within a conduit. Biotinylated quantum dots are used as a label to monitor target analyte binding to the bead's surface. Three-dimensional finite element simulations are carried out to model the binding kinetics on the bead's surface. The model accounts for surface exclusion effects resulting from a single quantum dot occluding multiple receptor sites. The theoretical predictions are compared and favorably agree with experimental observations. The theoretical simulations provide a useful tool to predict how varying parameters affect microbead reaction kinetics and sensor performance. This study enhances our understanding of bead-based microfluidic assays and provides a design tool for developers of point-of-care, lab-on-chip devices for medical diagnosis, food and water quality inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Minimally invasive procedures of this nature often result in damage to the arterial tissue culminating in the re-blocking of the vessel. In an effort to alleviate this phenomenon, known as restenosis, drug eluting stents were developed. They are similar in composition to a bare metal stent but encompass a coating with therapeutic agents designed to reduce the overly aggressive healing response that contributes to restenosis. There are many variables that can influence the effectiveness of these therapeutic drugs being transported from the stent coating to and within the artery wall, many of which have been analysed and documented by researchers. However, the physical deformation of the artery substructure due to stent expansion, and its influence on a drugs ability to diffuse evenly within the artery wall have been lacking in published work to date. The paper highlights previous approaches adopted by researchers and proposes the addition of porous artery wall deformation to increase model accuracy.},

Kinetic parameters suggest that adsorption may occur in a broadly similar fashion from both water and low-dielectric solvents, and that the fast adsorption step appears to be transport-limited for organic solvents but may experience an adsorption barrier in aqueous systems.},

The multivalent conjugation of targeting ligands on the surface of nanoparticles is presumed to enhance binding to the desired target. However, given the complexities inherent in the interactions of nanoparticle surfaces with proteins, and the structural diversity of nanoparticle scaffolds and targeting ligands, our understanding of how conjugation of targeting ligands affects nanoparticle binding remains incomplete. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to directly and quantitatively study the affinity and binding kinetics of nanoparticles that display small molecules conjugated to their surface. We studied the interaction between a single protein target and a structurally related series of targeting ligands whose intrinsic affinity varies over a 4500-fold range and performed SPR at protein densities that reflect endogenous receptor densities. We report that even weak small molecule targeting ligands can significantly enhance target-specific avidity (by up to 4 orders of magnitude) through multivalent interactions and also observe a much broader range of kinetic effects than has been previously reported. Quantitative measurement of how the affinity and kinetics of nanoparticle binding vary as a function of different surface conjugations is a rapid, generalizable approach to nanoparticle characterization that can inform the design of nanoparticles for biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {A quantitative understanding of the process of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into mammalian cells should assist the design and optimization of transduction protocols. We present a mathematical model of the process that incorporates the essential rate-limiting transduction steps including diffusion, convection and decay of viral vectors, their binding at the cell surface and entry into the cell cytoplasm, reverse transcription of uncoated RNA to form DNA intermediates, transport of the latter through the cytosol to the cell nucleus and, finally, nuclear import and integration of the delivered DNA into the target cell genome. Cell and virus population balances are used to account for the kinetics of multiple vector infections which influence the transduction efficiency and govern the integrated copy number. The mathematical model is validated using gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope pseudotyped retroviral vectors and K562 target cells. Viral intermediate complexes derived from the internalized retroviral vectors are found to remain stable inside the K562 cells and the cytoplasmic trafficking time is consistent with the time scale for retrovirus uncoating, reverse transcription and transport to the cell nucleus. The model predictions of transduction efficiency and integrated copy number agree well with experimental data for both static (i.e., standard gravity) and centrifugation-based gene transfer protocols. The formulation of the model can also be applied to transduction protocols involving lenti- or foamy-viruses and so should prove to be useful for the optimization of several types of gene transfer processes.},

	abstract = {Methodology for time-weighted average (TWA) air measurements of semivolatile organophosphate triesters, widely used flame-retardants and plasticizers, and common indoor pollutants is presented. Dynamic non-equilibrium solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for air sampling, in combination with GC/PICI and ion trap tandem MS, yields a fast, almost solvent-free method with low detection limits. Methanol was used as reagent gas for PICI, yielding stable protonated molecules and few fragments. A field sampler, in which a pumped airflow over three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 100-mum fibers in series was applied, was constructed, evaluated, and used for the measurements. The method LODs were in the range 2-26 ng m(-3) for a sampling period of 2 h. The uptake on the SPME fibers was shown to be about five times faster for triphenyl phosphate compared to the other investigated organophosphate esters, most likely due to more lipophilic properties of the aromatic compound. The boundary layer for triphenyl phosphate when using a 100-microm PDMS sorbent was determined to 0.08 mm at a linear air velocity of 34 cm s(-1). Five different organophosphate triesters were detected in air from a laboratory and a lecture hall, at concentrations ranging from 7 ng m(-3) up to 2.8 microg m(-3).},

These developments include introduction of various new biocompatible coating phases suitable for bioanalysis, such as commercial prototype in vivo SPME devices, as well as the development of sampling interfaces that extend the use of this methodology to small animals such as mice. These new devices permit application of in vivo SPME to a variety of analyses, including pharmacokinetics, bioaccumulation and metabolomics studies, with good temporal and spatial resolution. New calibration approaches have also been introduced to facilitate in vivo studies and provide fast and quantitative results without the need to achieve equilibrium. In combination with the drastic improvement in the analytical sensitivity of modern liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation, full potential of in vivo SPME as a sample preparation tool in life sciences can finally be explored. From the instrumentation perspective, SPME was successfully automated in 96-well format for the first time. This opens up new opportunities for high-throughput applications ({\textgreater}1000 samples/day) such as for the determination of unbound and total drug concentrations in complex matrices such as whole blood with no need for sample pretreatment, studies of distribution of drugs in various compartments and/or determination of plasma protein binding and other ligand-receptor binding studies, and this review will summarize the progress in this research area to date.},

	abstract = {Phenanthrene sorption and desorption from sediment/soil in fresh and saline water were measured, and effects of nanopores, solute concentration, and salinity on sorption-desorption hysteresis were discussed. The extent and kinetics of sorption-desorption hysteresis depend much on the pore distribution of the sorbents, and greater but slower-developed hysteresis occurred on the sorbent with higher specific surface area and more nanopores. In saline water, phenanthrene sorption was enhanced as compared to freshwater, with logKF increasing from 2.84 and 3.08 to 2.96 and 3.33 for the two sorbents, respectively; however, the sorption-desorption hysteresis was weakened, as indicated by the lower hysteresis index in saline water as compared to those in freshwater. In successive desorption, the irreversible sorbed amount of phenanthrene increased with increasing phenanthrene concentration until a maximum (Qmaxirr) was achieved, and the subsequent sorption became reversible. In saline water, Qmaxirr is much lower (10 mg kg(-1)) as compared to freshwater (36 mg kg(-1)), and phenanthrene sorption was almost reversible, especially at high concentrations. N2 sorption illustrated that soil organic matter had changed to a more condensed conformation in saline water, as indicted by the reduced surface area (from 9.6 to 7.3 m2 g(-1)), which is unfavorable for irreversible sorption.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of a preconcentrator design that can effectively increase the binding rate at the sensor in a real time manner. The particle enrichment is realized by the ac electrothermal (ACET) effect, which induces fluid movement to carry nanoparticles toward the sensor. The ACET is the only electrical method to manipulate a biological sample of medium to high ionic strength ({\textgreater}0.1 Sm, e.g., 0.06x phosphate buffered saline). The preconcentrator consists of a pair of electrodes striding over the sensor, simple to implement as it is electrically controlled. This preconcentrator design is compatible and can be readily integrated with many types of micro- to nanosensors. By applying an ac signal over the electrodes, local vortices will generate a large velocity perpendicular to the reaction surface, which enhances transport of analytes toward the sensor. Our simulation shows that the binding rate at the sensor surface is greatly enhanced. Our study also shows that the collection of analytes will be affected by various parameters such as channel height, inlet velocity, and sensor size, and our results will provide guidance in optimization of the preconcentrator design.},

Simple antibody-analyte binding reaction kinetics can be simulated by e.g. a mechanistic assay model based on differential equations. However, the mathematical modelling becomes more complicated if multivalent-structured components are involved and the number of binding complexes increases. In this paper, a new node-based method to model complex binding reactions is introduced. The principle of this method is to construct a network of the initial components, reaction intermediates and end-products by forming a network of nodes. This network is then solved, node by node, breaking the initial problem into smaller partial problems, still obeying the laws of chemical reaction kinetics and without ignoring any parts of the problem. This method provides an easy and quick way to study complex binding reactions since simulation networks are simple to construct directly from the reaction scheme. This presented new "NODE"-method is compared with the well known mechanistic assay model.},

	abstract = {Sorbent tubes/traps are widely used in combination with gas chromatographic (GC) analytical methods to monitor the vapour-phase fraction of organic compounds in air. Target compounds range in volatility from acetylene and freons to phthalates and PCBs and include apolar, polar and reactive species. Airborne vapour concentrations will vary depending on the nature of the location, nearby pollution sources, weather conditions, etc. Levels can range from low percent concentrations in stack and vent emissions to low part per trillion (ppt) levels in ultra-clean outdoor locations. Hundreds, even thousands of different compounds may be present in any given atmosphere. GC is commonly used in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) detection especially for environmental monitoring or for screening uncharacterised workplace atmospheres. Given the complexity and variability of organic vapours in air, no one sampling approach suits every monitoring scenario. A variety of different sampling strategies and sorbent media have been developed to address specific applications. Key sorbent-based examples include: active (pumped) sampling onto tubes packed with one or more sorbents held at ambient temperature; diffusive (passive) sampling onto sorbent tubes/cartridges; on-line sampling of air/gas streams into cooled sorbent traps; and transfer of air samples from containers (canisters, Tedlar) bags, etc.) into cooled sorbent focusing traps. Whichever sampling approach is selected, subsequent analysis almost always involves either solvent extraction or thermal desorption (TD) prior to GC(/MS) analysis. The overall performance of the air monitoring method will depend heavily on appropriate selection of key sampling and analytical parameters. This comprehensive review of air monitoring using sorbent tubes/traps is divided into 2 parts. (1) Sorbent-based air sampling option. (2) Sorbent selection and other aspects of optimizing sorbent-based air monitoring methods. The paper presents current state-of-the-art and recent developments in relevant areas such as sorbent research, sampler design, enhanced approaches to analytical quality assurance and on-tube derivatisation.},

The nd-SPME method was optimized for coating thickness (polyacrylate coating) and exposure time, and potential effects from the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied. It was shown that the addition of albumin did not cause fouling or influenced the uptake kinetics of CPZ into the fiber. At a realistic in vivo albumin concentration of 40 g/L of albumin, 94\% of CPZ was protein bound. This is in line with findings in vivo, reporting a protein binding for CPZ of 92-99\%. The nd-SPME-HPLC method described in this study can be used to measure the free concentration of chlorpromazine in medium containing proteins. These findings can be used to correct in vitro data for protein binding of chlorpromazine and this information is essential for the extrapolation to in vivo data.},

	abstract = {Desorption of pyrene and phenanthrene, from two charcoals and humic acid preloaded charcoals were studied. Desorption occurred obviously in two fractions, with rapid and slow desorption rate constant ranging from 0.18 to 0.71 d(-1), and from 6.3 x 10(-5) to 7.4 x 10(-3) d(-1), respectively. Both the kinetics and percentage extent of desorption were influenced greatly by the properties of chemical and charcoal. Generally, slower and less desorption is related to larger chemical at lower level, and occurred from charcoal with greater aromaticity and polarity. Both rapid and slow desorption rates of pyrene decreased after the two charcoals were preloaded with humic acids. This demonstrates that the size and surface property of charcoal micropores exhibit great influence on the combination state of sorbed chemicals. Aging caused a greater reduction in desorption of phenanthrene compared to pyrene, which supports the mechanism of the transferring of chemical molecules from fast-desorbing sites to slowly-desorbing sites during aging.},

In these analyses, sample preparation is essential for isolation of desired components from complex biological matrices and greatly influences their reliable and accurate determination. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is an effective sample preparation technique that has enabled miniaturization, automation and high-throughput performance. The use of SPME has reduced assay times, as well as the costs of solvents and disposal. This review focuses on recent advances in novel SPME techniques, including fiber SPME and in-tube SPME, in biomedical analysis. We also summarize the applications of these techniques to pharmacotherapeutic, forensic, and diagnostic studies, and to determinations of environmental and occupational exposure.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new experimental technique for measuring rates of desorption of organic compounds from dissolved organic matter (DOM) such as humic substances. The method is based on a fast solid-phase extraction of the freely dissolved fraction of a solute when the solution is flushed through a polymer-coated capillary. The extraction interferes with the solute-DOM sorption equilibrium and drives the desorption process. Solutes which remain sorbed to DOM pass through the extraction capillary and can be analyzed afterward. This technique allows a time resolution for the desorption kinetics from subseconds up to minutes. It is applicable to the study of interaction kinetics between a wide variety of hydrophobic solutes and polyelectrolytes. Due to its simplicity it is accessible for many environmental laboratories. The time-resolved in-tube solid-phase microextraction (TR-IT-SPME) was applied to two humic acids and a surfactant as sorbents together with pyrene, phenanthrene and 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane as solutes. The results give evidence for a two-phase desorption kinetics: a fast desorption step with a half-life of less than 1 s and a slow desorption step with a half-life of more than 1 min. For aliphatic solutes, the fast-desorbing fraction largely dominates, whereas for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as pyrene, the slowly desorbing, stronger-bound fraction is also important.},

This platform has the ability to form selective interactions between a therapeutic agent and host matrix that yields advantages over systems that employ nonselective methods. The incorporation of molecular interactions in drug delivery can increase the therapeutic lifetime of drug delivery implants and limit the need for multiple implants in treatment of chronic illnesses. To analyze this complex system for rational design of drug delivery implants, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model to quantify the molecular events and processes. With a beta-cyclodextrin hydrogel host matrix, defined release rates were obtained using a fluorescent model drug. The key processes were the complexation between the drug and cyclodextrin and diffusion of the drug in the hydrogel. Optimal estimates of the model parameters were obtained by minimizing the difference between model simulation and experimentally measured drug release kinetics. Model simulations could predict the drug release dynamics under a wide range of experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {The effect of solution pH and levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the sampling rates for model pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting substance (EDS) by polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) was investigated in laboratory experiments. A commercially available POCIS configuration containing neutral Oasis HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) resin (i.e. pharmaceutical POCIS) and two POCIS configurations prepared in-house containing MAX and MCX anion and cation exchange resins, respectively were tested for uptake of 21 model PPCPs and EDS, including acidic, phenolic, basic and neutral compounds. Laboratory experiments were conducted with dechlorinated tap water over a pH range of 3, 7 and 9. The effects of DOM were studied using natural water from an oligotrophic lake in Ontario, Canada (i.e. Plastic Lake) spiked with different amounts of DOM (the concentration of dissolved organic carbon ranged from 3 to 5mgL(-1) in uptake experiments). In experiments with the commercial (HLB) POCIS, the MCX-POCIS and the MAX-POCIS, the sampling rates generally increased with pH for basic compounds and declined with pH for acidic compounds. However, the sampling rates were relatively constant across the pH range for phenols with high pKa values (i.e. bisphenol A, estrone, estradiol, triclosan) and for the neutral pharmaceutical, carbamazepine. Thus, uptake was greatest when the amount of the neutral species in solution was maximized relative to the ionized species. Although the solution pH affected the uptake of some model ionic compounds, the effect was by less than a factor of 3. There was no significant effect of DOM on sampling rates from Plastic Lake. However, uptake rates in different aqueous matrixes declined in the order of deionized water{\textgreater}Plastic Lake water{\textgreater}dechlorinated tap water, so other parameters must affect uptake into POCIS, although this influence will be minor. MAX-POCIS and MCX-POCIS showed little advantage over the commercial POCIS configuration for monitoring in natural waters.},

The Anacostia River sediment studies represented exposure to a historically contaminated sediment with limited availability, whereas exposure to the other sediment included both the historically contaminated New Bedford Harbor sediment and fresh redistribution of contaminants into the Brown Lake sediments. Organism tissue concentrations did not correlate with bulk sediment concentrations in the Anacostia River sediment but did correlate with the sequentially diluted sediment. Porewater concentrations measured via disposable solid-phase microextraction fiber (SPME) with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), however, correlated well with organism uptake in all sediments. Bioaccumulation was predicted well by a linear relationship with the product of porewater concentration and compound octanol-water partition coefficient (Anacostia, slope = 1.08, r(2) = 0.76; sequentially diluted sediments, slope = 1.24, r(2) = 0.76). The data demonstrate that the octanol-water partition coefficient is a good indicator of the lipid-water partition coefficient and that porewater concentrations provide a more reliable indicator of bioaccumulation in the organism than sediment concentrations, even when the route of uptake is expected to be via sediment ingestion.},

In this study, a rapid and convenient SPME alternative calibration method for in vivo analysis, termed SPME-sampling rate (SPME-SR) calibration, was developed and validated under both laboratory and field conditions to eliminate such presampling requirements. Briefly, the SPME probe is inserted into tissue, in this study fish dorsal-epaxial muscle, for 20 min allowing the concentrations of target analytes in the fish muscle to be determined by the extracted amount of analyte and the predetermined sampling rates. Atrazine, carbamazepine, and fluoxetine were detected nonlethally in the low ppb levels within fish muscle, with both laboratory and field-derived results obtained by in vivo SPME-KC comparable (within a factor of 1.27) to those obtained by lethal sampling followed by tissue liquid extraction.

The ability to rapidly determine bioaccumulation of these contaminants in exposed fish without sacrificing the animal (i.e. in vivo) would be of significant advantage to facilitate research, assessment and monitoring of their risk to the environment. In this study, an in vivo solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) approach was developed and applied to the measurement of a variety of emerging contaminants (carbamazepine, naproxen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, bisphenol A, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and atrazine) in fish. Our results indicated in vivo SPME was a potential alternative extraction technique for quantitative determination of contaminants in lab exposures and as well after exposure to two municipal wastewater effluents (MWWE), with a major advantage over conventional techniques due to its ability to non-lethally sample tissues of living organisms.},

	abstract = {Lectins are the proteins which can distinguish glycosylation patterns. They are frequently used as biomarkers for progressions of several diseases including cancer. As the lectin microarray based prognosis devices miniaturize the process of glycoprofiling, it is anticipated that their performance can be augmented by integration with microfluidic framework. This is analogous to microfluidics based DNA arrays. However, unlike small oligonucleotide microarrays, it remains uncertain whether the binding reaction-kinetic parameters can be considered invariant of imposed hydrodynamics, for relatively larger and structure sensitive molecules such as lectins. Here we show, using two standard lectins namely Concanavalin A and Abrus Agglutinin, that the steady state binding efficiency unexpectedly declines beyond a critical shear rate magnitude. This observation can be explained only if the associated reaction constants are presumed to be functions of hydrodynamic parameters. We methodically deduce the shear rate dependence of association and dissociation constants from the comparison of experimental and model-simulation trends. The aforementioned phenomena are perceived to be the consequences of strong hydrodynamic perturbations, culminating into molecular structural distortion. The exploration, therefore, reveals a unique coupling between reaction kinetics and hydrodynamics for biomacromolecules and provides a generic scheme towards futuristic microfluidics-coupled biomedical assays.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systemically investigate, for a therapeutic protein with a circulating soluble target, how the interplay of target dynamics and drug pharmacokinetics defines the 'total' and 'free' drug and target temporal profiles. METHOD: By extending the established rapid-binding target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) pharmacokinetic model to circulating soluble targets, the temporal profiles of 'total' and 'free' drug and target were simulated with varying binding affinity (K(D)), target baseline (R(ss)), target turnover, and drug dose level. Two sets of published experimental data were compared with the simulated results. RESULTS: Binding to a circulating soluble target could lead to a divergence of the 'free' drug from the 'total' drug. Simulations show this divergent magnitude determined by K(D) and R(ss), with the temporal profile being defined by target turnover and drug dose level. As divergence proceeds, starting at the distribution phase, 'free' drug would decline faster but eventually parallel 'total' drug at the terminal phase, giving rise to a steeper distribution phase and comparable terminal half-life, relative to the 'total' form. The model also allows for estimation of the dynamic change of 'total' and 'free' target in response to the treatment of a therapeutic protein drug, facilitating dose level and regimen design to achieve desired 'free' target suppression. Model predictions compared favorably with two sets of published experimental data. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretical analyses identified key variables governing the different temporal profiles of 'total' and 'free' drug and target. The rapid-binding TMDD model reasonably captured the features of the interplay of drug pharmacokinetics and target dynamics for two reported cases.},

We describe an aptamer capturing approach that improves the specificity and the sensitivity of enzyme detection. An aptamer recognizing the target enzyme molecule is conjugated on a magnetic bead, increasing the local concentration, and serves as an affinity probe to capture and separate minute amounts of the enzyme. The captured enzymes catalyze the subsequent conversion of fluorogenic substrate to fluorescent products, enabling a sensitive measure of the active enzyme. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated through assays for human alpha thrombin and human neutrophil elastase (HNE), two important enzymes. Thrombin (2 fM) and 100 fM HNE can be detected. The incorporation of two binding events, substrate recognition and aptamer binding, greatly improves assay specificity. With its simplicity, this approach is applicable to biosensing and detection of disease biomarkers.},

For the first time, the effects of the sample binding matrix and tortuosity on the kinetics of analyte extraction (from the sample to the SPME fiber) are demonstrated to be quantitatively symmetrical with those of the desorption of preloaded deuterated standards (from the fiber to the sample matrix). Consequently, kinetic calibration methods can be employed to correct for variation in SPME sampling kinetics, facilitating the application of pre-equilibrium SPME within complex sample systems. This approach was applied ex vivo to measure pharmaceuticals in fish muscle tissues, with results consistent with those obtained from equilibrium SPME and microdialysis. The developed method has the inherent advantages of being more accurate, precise, and reproducible, thus providing the framework for applications where rapid measurement of free analyte concentrations (within complicated sample matrixes such as biological tissues, sediment, and surface water) are required.},

In this study, we characterized the complexity of matrix effects (ME) by analyzing SPME extracts of fish muscle and brain tissue, blood, and bile, as well as tap water, surface water, and the influent and effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. Significant enhancement or suppression of ionization ({\textgreater}15\%) was observed with all biological and environmental samples. Intrasample ME variability was assessed through comparison of multiple samples from the same sample matrix, while intersample variability between different experimental subjects or varying sample treatment, storage, and sampling conditions were evaluated. To correct for ME, an isotopic internal standard (IIS) method was developed, with the strengths and limitations of the approach discussed. This study provides a framework for applying SPME within complex sample systems where the influences of ME are inevitable, thus ensuring more accurate quantitation of analytes during biological and environmental analysis.},

	abstract = {A novel solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber was fabricated by electrospinning method in which a polymeric solution was converted to nanofibers using high voltages. A thin stainless steel wire was coated by the network of polymeric nanofibers. The polymeric nanofiber coating on the wire was mechanically stable due to the fine and continuous nanofibers formation around the wire with a three dimensional structure. Polyamide (nylon 6), due to its suitable characteristics was used to prepare the unbreakable SPME nanofiber. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of this new coating showed a diameter range of 100-200 nm for polyamide nanofibers with a homogeneous and porous surface structure. The extraction efficiency of new coating was investigated for headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) of some environmentally important chlorophenols from aqueous samples followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Effect of different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency including extraction temperature, extraction time, ionic strength and polyamide amount were investigated and optimized. In order to improve the chromatographic behavior of phenolic compounds, all the analytes were derivatized prior to the extraction process using basic acetic anhydride. The detection limits of the method under optimized conditions were in the range of 2-10 ng L(-1). The relative standard deviations (RSD) (n=3) at the concentration level of 1.7-6.7 ng mL(-1) were obtained between 1 and 7.4\%. The calibration curves of chlorophenols showed linearity in the range of 27-1330 ng L(-1) for phenol and monochlorophenols and 7-1000 ng L(-1) for dichloro and trichlorophenols. Also, the proposed method was successfully applied to the extraction of phenol and chlorophenols from real water samples and relative recoveries were between 84 and 98\% for all the selected analytes except for 2,4,6 tricholophenol which was between 72 and 74\%.},

Solid phase extraction (SPE) has been applied for the isolation of these from aqueous matrices, employing various materials. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of functional groups on the sorption of the solutes onto these materials. Therefore, the sorption interactions of (charged) polar organic solutes to neutral (HLB), cation-exchanging (MCX, WCX), and anion-exchanging (MAX, WAX) OASIS polymers have been studied. For neutral solutes HLB has the highest capacity and affinity. Van der Waals interaction, rather than hydrogen bonding, appears to be the predominant factor determining sorption. For charged molecules, MCX and MAX show by far the highest affinity and capacity. Adsorption is already efficient at low concentrations and the maximum sorption capacity equals the amount of charged functional groups on the material. The results from this study allow semiquantitative predictions if a solute will adsorb on one of the OASIS materials and which functional groups govern adsorption.},

	abstract = {The binding of carbamazepine to human serum albumin was studied in vitro using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (LC-UV), as well as spectroscopic fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) techniques. We were able to recognize one high affinity binding site with both fluorescence and SPME methods. Additionally, SPME experiment showed the existence of one lower affinity binding site for carbamazepine at the range of concentrations studied with fluorescence. The analysis of Hill's plot indicated positive cooperativity between drugs located in these two binding sites. Two low affinity-binding sites have been found with SPME-LC-UV analysis performed in parallel to (1)H NMR study, which does not show any complex formation. In conclusion, the results of the studies with carbamazepine as a model drug showed the advantages of simultaneous use of solid phase microextraction and spectroscopic methods in protein binding studies and indicated complementary information, which can be obtained with the use of SPME. Furthermore, we show that SPME in combination with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry permitted direct in vitro determination of plasma-protein binding and direct in vivo evaluation of inter-animal variability in free concentrations of carbamazepine at physiologically relevant concentrations, the type of experiments typically inaccessible by spectroscopic techniques due to poor sensitivity and different mode of implementation.},

	abstract = {Porous agarose microbeads, with high surface to volume ratios and high binding densities, are attracting attention as highly sensitive, affordable sensor elements for a variety of high performance bioassays. While such polymer microspheres have been extensively studied and reported on previously and are now moving into real-world clinical practice, very little work has been completed to date to model the convection, diffusion, and binding kinetics of soluble reagents captured within such fibrous networks. Here, we report the development of a three-dimensional computational model and provide the initial evidence for its agreement with experimental outcomes derived from the capture and detection of representative protein and genetic biomolecules in 290 mum porous beads. We compare this model to antibody-mediated capture of C-reactive protein and bovine serum albumin, along with hybridization of oligonucleotide sequences to DNA probes. These results suggest that, due to the porous interior of the agarose bead, internal analyte transport is both diffusion and convection based, and regardless of the nature of analyte, the bead interiors reveal an interesting trickle of convection-driven internal flow. On the basis of this model, the internal to external flow rate ratio is found to be in the range of 1:170 to 1:3100 for beads with agarose concentration ranging from 0.5\% to 8\% for the sensor ensembles here studied. Further, both model and experimental evidence suggest that binding kinetics strongly affect analyte distribution of captured reagents within the beads. These findings reveal that high association constants create a steep moving boundary in which unbound analytes are held back at the periphery of the bead sensor. Low association constants create a more shallow moving boundary in which unbound analytes diffuse further into the bead before binding. These models agree with experimental evidence and thus serve as a new tool set for the study of bioagent transport processes within a new class of medical microdevices.},

	abstract = {Hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) has been demonstrated to potentially become a mainstream sample preparation technique for complex samples. Nevertheless, the need for a relatively long extraction time is considered to be the major disadvantage of this method. Lengthy extractions may cause the loss of the extraction phase and may change the contents of biological samples via the action of enzymes. Therefore, control calibrations for particular biological systems must be made. In this study, a theoretical model of the mass transfer dynamics of two-phase HF-LPME was proposed, and the kinetic calibration (KC) of this method for plasma and urine samples was validated. The theoretical results were validated by examining the kinetics of the extraction and back-extraction processes of HF-LPME. The KC-HF-LPME method was successfully used to correct for matrix effects in plasma and urine samples during flunitrazepam analysis. The free amount of flunitrazepam was extracted from plasma for 10 min and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The amount of pre-added standard and the standard remaining in the extraction phase after extraction were used for the quantification of flunitrazepam in plasma and urine samples. The new method not only significantly shortens the extraction time but also provides a new opportunity to determine the free concentration of analyte in biological systems.},

	abstract = {Adsorption onto the walls of micropores was explored by computational simulations involving cyclic voltammetry of ion transfer across an interface between aqueous and organic phases located at the micropore. Micro-interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (micro-ITIES) have been of particular research interest in recent years and show promise for biosensor and biomedical applications. The simulation model combines diffusion to and within the micropore, Butler-Volmer kinetics for ion transfer at the liquid-liquid interface, and Langmuir-style adsorption on the pore wall. Effects due to pore radius, adsorption and desorption rates, surface adsorption site density, and scan rates were examined. It was found that the magnitude of the reverse peak current decreased due to adsorption of the transferring ion on the pore wall; this decrease was more marked as the scan rate was increased. There was also a shift in the half-wave potential to lower values following adsorption, consistent with a wall adsorption process which provides a further driving force to transfer ions across the ITIES. Of particular interest was the disappearance of the reverse peak from the cyclic voltammogram at higher scan rates, compared to the increase in the reverse peak size in the absence of wall adsorption. This occurred for scan rates of 50 mV s(-1) and above and may be useful in biosensor applications using micropore-based ITIES.},

Some examples are conductivity measurements in nanowires, deflection of cantilevers and spectroscopy of plasmonic nanoparticles. The fact that these techniques are based on the special properties of nanostructural entities provides for extreme sensor miniaturization since a single structural unit often can be used as transducer. This review discusses the advantages and problems with such small sensors, with focus on biosensing applications and label-free real-time analysis of liquid samples. Many aspects of sensor design are considered, such as thermodynamic and diffusion aspects on binding kinetics as well as multiplexing and noise issues. Still, all issues discussed are generic in the sense that the conclusions apply to practically all types of surface sensitive techniques. As a counterweight to the current research trend, it is argued that in many real world applications, better performance is achieved if the active sensor is larger than that in typical nanosensors. Although there are certain specific sensing applications where nanoscale transducers are necessary, it is argued herein that this represents a relatively rare situation. Instead, it is suggested that sensing on the microscale often offers a good compromise between utilizing some possible advantages of miniaturization while avoiding the complications. This means that ensemble measurements on multiple nanoscale sensors are preferable instead of utilizing a single transducer entity.},

	abstract = {Passive sampling was used to deduce water concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the vicinity of a marine Superfund site on the Palos Verdes Shelf, California, USA. Precalibrated solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers and polyethylene (PE) strips that were preloaded with performance reference compounds (PRCs) were codeployed for 32 d along an 11-station gradient at bottom, surface, and midwater depths. Retrieved samplers were analyzed for DDT congeners and their breakdown products (DDE, DDD, DDMU, and DDNU) and 43 PCB congeners using GC-EI- and NCI-MS. PRCs were used to calculate compound-specific fractional equilibration achieved in situ for the PE samplers, using both an exponential approach to equilibrium (EAE) and numerical integration of Fickian diffusion (NI) models. The highest observed concentrations were for p,p'-DDE, with 2200 and 990 pg/L deduced from PE and SPME, respectively. The difference in these estimates could be largely attributed to uncertainty in equilibrium partition coefficients, unaccounted for disequilibrium between samplers and water, or different time scales over which the samplers average. The concordance between PE and SPME estimated concentrations for DDE was high (R(2) = 0.95). PCBs were only detected in PE samplers, due to their much larger size. Near-bottom waters adjacent to and down current from sediments with the highest bulk concentrations exhibited aqueous concentrations of DDTs and PCBs that exceeded Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC) for human and aquatic health, indicating the need for future monitoring to determine the effectiveness of remedial activities taken to reduce adverse effects of contaminated surface sediments.},

In particular, we study the transport dynamics in a model geometry of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. The work, however, is equally relevant for other microfluidic surface-based biosensors, operating under flow conditions. A widely adopted approximate quasi-steady theory to capture convective and diffusive mass transport is reviewed, and an analytical solution is presented. An expression of the Damkohler number is derived in terms of the nondimensional adsorption coefficient (Biot number), the nondimensional flow rate (Peclet number), and the model geometry. Transient dynamics is investigated, and we quantify the error of using the quasi-steady-state assumption for experimental data fitting in both kinetically limited and convection-diffusion-limited regimes for irreversible adsorption, in specific. The results clarify the conditions under which the quasi-steady theory is reliable or not. In extension to the well-known fact that the range of validity is altered under convection-diffusion-limited conditions, we show how also the ratio of the inlet concentration to the maximum surface capacity is critical for reliable use of the quasi-steady theory. Finally, our results provide users of surface-based biosensors with a tool for correcting experimentally obtained adsorption rate constants.},

	abstract = {Organic chemicals may be released when consumer goods are used, contributing to environmental and human levels of potentially hazardous chemicals. A generic model was developed to predict emissions of organic chemicals from various materials in consumer products. The model involved three modules, which each predict a key parameter needed to calculate the mass of individual chemicals emitted. Partition coefficients between a material and the surrounding air were predicted using Abraham solvation parameters, diffusion coefficients in materials were calculated using the Piringer equation, and convective mass transfer coefficients were evaluated by applying the Chilton-Colburn analogy. The calculated emission rates from predicted parameters were evaluated and agreed well with literature data. The release of plasticizers from vinyl flooring used in Sweden was calculated to demonstrate the utility of the generic model. The estimated emitted masses of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), di-iso-nonylphthalate (DINP), and 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid di-iso-nonyl ester (DINCH) in 2012 were 210 kg, 40 kg, and 3.6 kg respectively. Emissions from vinyl flooring were estimated for the period 1990 to 2035 and it was shown that the recent substitution of DEHP with DINP will help to reduce plasticizer emissions. Model calculations for alternative plasticizers revealed that DINCH would yield similar emissions to DINP, whereas use of diethyl hexyl-iso-sorbide or diethyl hexyl adipate would result in higher emissions.},

Poly(dimethylsiloxane)-coated solid-phase microextration (PDMS-SPME) fiber-water partition coefficient (K(f)) values for eight common-use pyrethroids were determined using a two-compartment mass balance model and parameters determined in experimental seawater microcosms. Mass balance, epimerization, and aqueous-phase degradation (i.e., hydrolysis) were characterized using gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry to facilitate K(f) estimation. Of the eight pyrethroids, only bifenthrin exhibited increasing sorption on the SPME fiber over the entire time-series exposure, indicating that its K(f) value could be estimated through a stable-compound model. The remaining pyrethroids were found to be unstable (half-life of {\textless}22 days), underscoring the importance of accounting for degradation in estimating K(f). The two-compartment model explained the experimental time-series data for bifenthrin (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.98) and the remaining unstable pyrethroids (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.7), leading to estimated values of log K(f) between 5.7 and 6.4, after correcting for residual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the experimental seawater. These K(f) values can be used to determine freely dissolved pyrethroid concentrations in the pg/L range using PDMS-SPME in fresh or seawater matrices under equilibrium conditions in laboratory or field applications.},

	abstract = {The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), a classic acute phase plasma protein, increases rapidly in response to tissue infection or inflammation, especially in cases of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Thus, highly sensitive monitoring of the CRP concentration plays a pivotal role in detecting these diseases. Many researchers have studied methods for the detection of CRP concentrations such as optical, mechanical, and electrochemical techniques inside microfluidic devices. While significant progress has been made towards improving the resolution and sensitivity of detection, only a few studies have systematically analyzed the CRP concentration using both numerical and experimental approaches. Specifically, systematic analyses of the electrochemical detection of high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) inside a microfluidic device have never been conducted. In this paper, we systematically analyzed the electrochemical detection of CRP modified through the attachment of an alkaline phosphatase (ALP-labeled CRP) using ELISA inside a chip. For this analysis, we developed a model based on antigen-antibody binding kinetics theory for the numerical quantification of the CRP concentration. We also experimentally measured the current value corresponding to the ALP-labeled CRP concentration inside the microfluidic chip. The measured value closely matched the calculated value obtained by numerical simulation using the developed model. Through this comparison, we validated the numerical simulation methods, and the calculated and measured values. Lastly, we examined the effects of various microfluidic parameters on electrochemical detection of the ALP-labeled CRP concentration using numerical simulations. The results of these simulations provide insight into the microfluidic electrochemical reactions used for protein detection. Furthermore, the results described in this study should be useful for the design and optimization of electrochemical immunoassay chips for the detection of target proteins.},

	abstract = {We present here a binding-induced fluorescence turn-on assay for protein detection. Key features of this assay include affinity binding-induced DNA hybridization and fluorescence enhancement of silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) using guanine-rich DNA sequences. In an example of an assay for human alpha-thrombin, two aptamers (Apt15 and Apt29) were used and were modified by including additional sequence elements. A 12-nucleotide (nt) sequence was used to link the first aptamer with a nanocluster nucleation sequence at the 5'-end. The second aptamer was linked through a complementary sequence (12-nt) to a G-rich overhang at the 3'-end. Binding of the two aptamer probes to the target protein initiates hybridization between the complementary linker sequences attached to each aptamer and thereby bring the end of the G-rich overhang to close proximity to Ag NCs, resulting in a significant fluorescence enhancement. With this approach, a detection limit of 1 nM and a linear dynamic range of 5 nM-2 muM were achieved for human alpha-thrombin. This fluorescence assay is performed in a single tube, and it does not require washing or separation steps. The principle of the binding-induced DNA hybridization and fluorescence enhancement of Ag NCs can be extended to other homogeneous assay applications provided that two appropriate probes are available to bind with the same target molecule.},

	abstract = {For the first time, the competitive adsorption of inhibited cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A, an exoglucanase) and endoglucanase I (Cel7B) from T. longibrachiatum is studied on cellulose. Using quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM), sorption histories are measured for individual types of cellulases and their mixtures adsorbing to and desorbing from a model cellulose surface. We find that Cel7A has a higher adsorptive affinity for cellulose than does Cel7B. The adsorption of both cellulases becomes irreversible on time scales of 30-60 min, which are much shorter than those typically used for industrial cellulose hydrolysis. A multicomponent Langmuir kinetic model including first-order irreversible binding is proposed. Although adsorption and desorption rate constants differ between the two enzymes, the rate at which each surface enzyme irreversibly binds is identical. Because of the higher affinity of Cel7A for the cellulose surface, when Cel7A and Cel7B compete for surface sites, a significantly higher bulk concentration of Cel7B is required to achieve comparable surface enzyme concentrations. Because cellulose deconstruction benefits significantly from the cooperative activity of endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases on the cellulose surface, accounting for competitive adsorption is crucial to developing effective cellulase mixtures.},

	abstract = {Abstract:  The volatility of flavor compounds (10 distinctive esters commonly found in alcoholic beverages) was characterized using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) analysis combined with mathematical modeling. The impacts of extrinsic factors (extraction time and temperature) and intrinsic parameters (ethanol content and concentration of these flavor compounds) were evaluated on their influences. From extraction profiles, different kinetic behaviors of flavor compounds revealed that volatility is influenced by chemical natures (that is, molecular weight and physicochemical properties). Moreover, volatility was also found to be interrelated with extraction temperature and absorption/adsorption on the fiber's surface. Through mathematical modeling, the kinetic constants of these volatile compounds were computed, and their release profiles were determined. Finally, it was observed that an increase of ethanol (a competitive interference compound to flavor compounds) could decrease the extraction efficiency. Our studies indicated that this approach might be a rapid and practical method that would provide a better understanding of flavor release behavior from alcoholic beverages. Practical Application:  The proposed approach may provide a simple and fast method in predicting the performance of key aroma esters in different alcoholic beverages. It could also be a practical way in quality control during the production of alcoholic beverage by monitoring key aroma esters.},

The results indicated that while HS-SPME was a rapid and valuable technique, poor reproducibility occurred under all conditions. It was found that this deficiency could be alleviated by utilising mathematical modelling techniques, an approach which had not been previously used in the analysis of flavour compounds in chewing gum by HS-SPME. Compared to the instrumental analysis data themselves, the models provided more insights to the release behaviour of flavour compounds from chewing gum and the more reproducible kinetic rate constants might be used for comparing the release of different compounds or the same compound under different conditions.},

In order to improve the reproducibility in quantification, a mathematical model with its root in psychological modeling and chemical reactor modeling was developed, describing the kinetic behavior of aroma active compounds extracted by SPME from two different food model systems, i.e., a semi-solid food and a liquid food. The model accounted for both adsorption and release of the analytes from SPME fiber, which occurred simultaneously but were counter-directed. The model had four parameters and their estimated values were found to be more reproducible than the direct measurement of the compounds themselves by instrumental analysis. With the relative standard deviations (RSD) of each parameter less than 5\% and root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.15, the model was proved to be a robust one in estimating the release of a wide range of low molecular weight acetates at three environmental temperatures i.e., 30, 40 and 60 °C. More insights of SPME behavior regarding the small molecule analytes were also obtained through the kinetic parameters and the model itself.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of metabolism is a significant outstanding challenge in toxicology. The best predictions are based on experimental data from in vitro systems using primary hepatocytes. The predictivity of the primary hepatocyte-based culture systems, however, is still limited due to well-known phenotypic instability and rapid decline of metabolic competence within a few hours. Dynamic flow bioreactors for three-dimensional cell cultures are thought to be better at recapitulating tissue microenvironments and show potential to improve in vivo extrapolations of chemical or drug toxicity based on in vitro test results. These more physiologically relevant culture systems hold potential for extending metabolic competence of primary hepatocyte cultures as well. In this investigation, we used computational fluid dynamics to determine the optimal design of a flow-based hepatocyte culture system for evaluating chemical metabolism in vitro. The main design goals were (1) minimization of shear stress experienced by the cells to maximize viability, (2) rapid establishment of a uniform distribution of test compound in the chamber, and (3) delivery of sufficient oxygen to cells to support aerobic respiration. Two commercially available flow devices – RealBio® and QuasiVivo® (QV) – and a custom developed fluidized bed bioreactor were simulated, and turbulence, flow characteristics, test compound distribution, oxygen distribution, and cellular oxygen consumption were analyzed. Experimental results from the bioreactors were used to validate the simulation results. Our results indicate that maintaining adequate oxygen supply is the most important factor to the long-term viability of liver bioreactor cultures. Cell density and system flow patterns were the major determinants of local oxygen concentrations. The experimental results closely corresponded to the in silico predictions. Of the three bioreactors examined in this study, we were able to optimize the experimental conditions for long-term hepatocyte cell culture using the QV bioreactor. This system facilitated the use of low system volumes coupled with higher flow rates. This design supports cellular respiration by increasing oxygen concentrations in the vicinity of the cells and facilitates long-term kinetic studies of low clearance test compounds. These two goals were achieved while simultaneously keeping the shear stress experienced by the cells within acceptable limits.},

For the model development, external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion steps were considered and the specific simplifications were based on the system characteristics. The proposed diffusional mass transfer model agreed very well with the experimental curves, indicating that the surface diffusion was the rate limiting step.

Several papers have reported this problem, but the reasons behind this behavior are not yet fully understood. In the present study, state-of-the-art reversed-phase wide-pore stationary phases were used to evaluate the adsorption of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. These biomolecules possess molar mass of approximately 150 000 g/mol and isoelectric points between 6.6 and 9.3. Two types of stationary phases were tested, the Phenomenex Aeris Widepore (silica based), with 3.6 μm superficially porous particles, and the Waters Acquity BEH300 (ethylene-bridged hybrid), with 1.7 μm fully porous particles. A systematic investigation was carried out using 11 immunoglobulin G1, G2, and G4 antibodies, namely, panitumumab, natalizumab, cetuximab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, rituximab, palivizumab, belimumab, adalimumab, denosumab, and ofatumumab. All are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in various therapeutic indications and are considered as reference antibodies. Several test proteins, such as human serum albumin, transferrin, apoferritin, ovalbumin, and others, possessing a molar mass between 42 000 and 443 000 g/mol were also evaluated to draw reliable conclusions. The purpose of this study was to find a correlation between the adsorption of monoclonal antibodies and their physicochemical properties. Therefore, the impact of isoelectric point, molar mass, protein glycosylation, and hydrophobicity was investigated. The adsorption of intact antibodies on the stationary phase was significantly higher than that of proteins of similar size, isoelectric point, or hydrophobicity. The present study also demonstrates the unique behavior of monoclonal antibodies, contributing some unwanted and unpredictable strong secondary interactions.},

In this assay, the fabric is placed between two wet filter papers and covered by glass surfaces on both sides. Pressure is applied on the glass surfaces in which bloodstains transfer onto the filter papers through capillary forces. Detected stains can be tested with other more sensitive presumptive blood tests performed on the filter paper. Even more, DNA analysis can be performed on the transferred bloodstains. The presented visualization assay is easy to perform, extremely cheap, requires little hands on time, and does not affect bloodstain pattern analysis.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE

Data analysis is a key step in mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics, starting with the generation of generic peak lists from raw liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data. Due to the use of various algorithms by different workflows, the results of different peak-picking strategies often differ widely.

METHODS

Raw LC/HRMS data from two types of biological samples (bile and urine), as well as a standard mixture of 84 metabolites, were processed with four peak-picking softwares: Peakview®, Markerview™, MetabolitePilot™ and XCMS Online. The overlaps between the results of each peak-generating method were then investigated. To gauge the relevance of peak lists, a database search using the METLIN online database was performed to determine which features had accurate masses matching known metabolites as well as a secondary filtering based on MS/MS spectral matching.

RESULTS

In this study, only a small proportion of all peaks (less than 10\%) were common to all four software programs. Comparison of database searching results showed peaks found uniquely by one workflow have less chance of being found in the METLIN metabolomics database and are even less likely to be confirmed by MS/MS.

CONCLUSIONS

It was shown that the performance of peak-generating workflows has a direct impact on untargeted metabolomics results. As it was demonstrated that the peaks found in more than one peak detection workflow have higher potential to be identified by accurate mass as well as MS/MS spectrum matching, it is suggested to use the overlap of different peak-picking workflows as preliminary peak lists for more rugged statistical analysis in global metabolomics investigations.

	abstract = {Biomarkers are measurable indicators of a biological state. As our understanding of diseases meliorates, it is generally accepted that early diagnosis renders the best chance to cure a disease. In the context of proteomics, the discovery phase of identifying bonafide biomarkers and the ensuing validation phase involving large cohort of patient samples are impeded by the complexity of bodily fluid samples. High abundant proteins found in blood plasma make it difficult for the detection of low abundant proteins that may be potential biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have reignited interest in the field of biomarker discovery. EVs contain a tissue-type signature wherein a rich cargo of proteins and RNA are selectively packaged. In addition, as EVs are membranous structures, the luminal contents are protected from degradation by extracellular proteases and are highly stable in storage conditions. Interestingly, an appealing feature of EV-based biomarker analysis is the significant reduction in the sample complexity compared to whole bodily fluids. With these prescribed attributes, which are the rate-limiting factors of traditional biomarker analysis, there is immense potential for the use of EVs for biomarker detection in clinical settings. This review will discuss the current issues with biomarker analysis and the potential use of EVs as reservoirs of disease biomarkers.},

The method relies on change in binding rate with varying flow rate at high ligand concentration where mass transport from bulk to surface with immobilized ligand becomes partially rate limiting. Prior study of binding kinetics is not necessary. If the molecular weight and the diffusion coefficient of the analyte protein are known, no standard with a known concentration is required. From numeric computer simulations a simple analytical expression for the mass transport coefficient derived at totally mass transport limiting conditions is shown to be applicable for conditions of partial mass transport limitation. Simple one to one association is assumed in deriving the method, but it is applicable even with more complex kinetics due to a bivalent analyte or heterogeneity of analyte or ligand.},

	abstract = {Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a wave phenomenon occurring at a metal-dielectric interface. A SPR-based biosensor operates by monitoring changes in the refractive index close to the interface that are produced in response to the interaction between the analyte and the receptors immobilized on the metal’s surface. The performance of these sensors depends on many parameters, including channel geometry, material properties and parameters related to chemical interaction between the analyte and immobilized receptors. This paper presents an integrated model that predicts the sensitivity of an SPR-based sensing platform under the Kretschmann configuration. The model uses the analytical solution of the differential equations that describe the analyte-bioreceptor interaction to correlate changes in analyte concentration to changes in refractive index at the sensing surface. These results are then connected with COMSOL simulations that relate changes in refractive index to changes in the SPR reflectivity curves. The resultant relations are integrated and the model is evaluated under different scenarios. This model will aid in the optimization of assay parameters prior to experimentation for maximum sensitivity; saving both time and expensive chemical reagents during the experimental phase.},

Also, in other biomedical and clinical applications, sensitive, precise and accurate methods are needed to determine the concentration of biologically active molecules, which frequently constitute only a fraction of the total molecular pool. Here we report a novel development of the approach to determining active concentrations based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The method relies on changes in binding rates with varying flow rates under conditions of partial mass transport, and does not require standards of known concentrations, given that the molecular mass of the molecule of interest is known. We introduce an analytical solution to the differential equations describing the formation of a 1:1 bimolecular complex, taking into account both the association and dissociation reactions, under partial mass transport limitations. This solution can be used in global fitting to binding curves obtained at different flow rates. The accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of this approach were determined in experiments involving binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant proteins to anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, where the active concentration could be determined independently by in vitro phosphorylation with 33P. There was an excellent agreement between the active concentrations determined by the analytical SPR-based method and by determination of the level of radioactivity of the phosphorylated protein. The SPR-based method allows determination of protein concentrations at picomolar levels. A procedure for accurate determinations of association and dissociation rate constants, based on the analytical solution of the mass transport and binding theory, is outlined.},

	abstract = {Surface-based binding assays are often influenced by the transport of analyte to the sensor surface. Using simulated data sets, we test a simple two-compartment model to see if its description of transport and binding is sufficient to accurately analyze BIACORE data. First we present a computer model that can generate realistic BIACORE data. This model calculates the laminar flow of analyte within the flow cell, its diffusion both perpendicular and parallel to the sensor surface, and the reversible chemical reaction between analyte and immobilized reactant. We use this computer model to generate binding data under a variety of conditions. An analysis of these data sets with the two-compartment model demonstrates that good estimates of the intrinsic reaction rate constants are recovered even when mass transport influences the binding reaction. We also discuss the conditions under which the two-compartment model can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. Our results illustrate that this model can significantly extend the range of association rate constants that can be accurately determined from BIACORE.},

	abstract = {In complex biological samples such as serum, determination of specific and active concentration of target proteins, independent of a calibration curve, will be valuable in many applications. Calibration-free concentration analysis (CFCA) is a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based label-free approach, which calculates active concentration of proteins using their known diffusion coefficient and observed changes in binding rates at different flow rates under diffusion-limited conditions. Here, for the first time we demonstrate the application of CFCA for determining protein biomarker abundance, specifically serum amyloid A (SAA), directly in the serum samples of patients suffering from different infectious and non-infectious diseases. The assay involves preparation of appropriate reaction surfaces by immobilizing antibodies on CM5 chips via amine coupling followed by serum sample preparation and injection over activated and reference surfaces at flow-rates of 5 and 100 μL/min. The system was validated in healthy and diseased (infectious and non-infectious) serum samples by quantifying two different proteins: β2-microglobulin (β2M) and SAA. All concentration assays were performed for nearly 100 serum samples, which showed reliable quantification in unattended runs with high accuracy and sensitivity. The method could detect the serum β2M to as low as 13 ng/mL in 1000-fold serum dilution, indicating the possible utility of this approach to detect low abundance protein biomarkers in body fluids. Applying the CFCA approach, significant difference in serum abundance of SAA was identified in diseased subjects as compared to the healthy controls, which correlated well with our previous proteomic investigations. Estimation of SAA concentration for a subset of healthy and diseased sera was also performed using ELISA, and the trend was observed to be similar in both SPR assay and ELISA. The reproducibility of CFCA in various serum samples made the interpretation of assay simple and reliable. This study illustrates a significant step forward in rapid monitoring of several protein markers in serum samples, with utility in biomarker validation and other therapeutic applications.},

It is vital for the judgment of protein quality and for monitoring the effect of therapeutic agents. Protein concentration values are typically obtained by comparison to a standard and derived from a standard curve. The use of a protein standard is convenient, but may not give reliable results if samples and standards behave differently. In other cases, a standard preparation may not be available and has to be established and validated. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors, an alternative concentration method is possible. This method is called calibration-free concentration analysis (CFCA); it generates active concentration data directly and without the use of a standard. The active concentration of a protein is defined through its interaction with its binding partner. This concentration can differ from the total protein concentration if some protein fraction is incapable of binding. If a protein has several different binding sites, active concentration data can be established for each binding site using site-specific interaction partners. This review will focus on CFCA analysis. It will reiterate the theory of CFCA and describe how CFCA has been applied in different research segments. The major part of the review will, however, try to set expectations on CFCA and discuss how CFCA can be further developed for absolute and relative concentration measurements.},

	abstract = {Background
Our body fluids contain a multitude of cell-derived vesicles, secreted by most cell types, commonly referred to as extracellular vesicles. They have attracted considerable attention for their function as intercellular communication vehicles in a broad range of physiological processes and pathological conditions. Extracellular vesicles and especially the smallest type, exosomes, have also generated a lot of excitement in view of their potential as disease biomarkers or as carriers for drug delivery. In this context, state-of-the-art techniques capable of comprehensively characterizing vesicles in biological fluids are urgently needed.
Scope of review
This review presents the arsenal of techniques available for quantification and characterization of physical properties of extracellular vesicles, summarizes their working principles, discusses their advantages and limitations and further illustrates their implementation in extracellular vesicle research.
Major conclusions
The small size and physicochemical heterogeneity of extracellular vesicles make their physical characterization and quantification an extremely challenging task. Currently, structure, size, buoyant density, optical properties and zeta potential have most commonly been studied. The concentration of vesicles in suspension can be expressed in terms of biomolecular or particle content depending on the method at hand. In addition, common quantification methods may either provide a direct quantitative measurement of vesicle concentration or solely allow for relative comparison between samples.
General significance
The combination of complementary methods capable of detecting, characterizing and quantifying extracellular vesicles at a single particle level promises to provide new exciting insights into their modes of action and to reveal the existence of vesicle subpopulations fulfilling key biological tasks.},

Under certain conditions, the observed binding rate can be used directly to obtain the concentration of the molecule in solution, without the use of any standard. This type of assay is referred to as Calibration Free Concentration Analysis, CFCA. By examining experimental conditions, including immobilization levels and temperature, for a range of analytes, and by using global analysis of several sample dilutions, conditions that gave the most robust results were identified. These conditions provided the concentration values that were on average ∼15\% lower than those obtained using other methods. The accuracy of the concentration determined may be related to how the analyte is distributed in the dextran matrix and to its distance from the gold surface, and may thereby depend on the conversion of the SPR signal to mass. A good precision of CFCA, ∼8\% (n = 21), was demonstrated when this method was used to efficiently guide purification procedures of Interferon α-2a. In this paper, the theory behind CFCA and the future developments, as well as the application of CFCA for absolute and relative concentration measurements (including the assessment of the potency of a biotherapeutic medicine) are discussed, and new evaluation tools that broaden the range of applications, are introduced.},

	abstract = {Radioactive, chromogenic, fluorescent and other labels have long provided the basis of detection systems for biomolecular interactions including immunoassays and receptor binding studies. However there has been unprecedented growth in a number of powerful label free biosensor technologies over the last decade. While largely at the proof-of-concept stage in terms of clinical applications, the development of more accessible platforms may see surface plasmon resonance (SPR) emerge as one of the most powerful optical detection platforms for the real-time monitoring of biomolecular interactions in a label-free environment., In this review, we provide an overview of SPR principles and current and future capabilities in a diagnostic context, including its application for monitoring a wide range of molecular markers of disease. The advantages and pitfalls of using SPR to study biomolecular interactions are discussed, with particular emphasis on its potential to differentiate subspecies of analytes and the inherent ability for quantitation through calibration-free concentration analysis (CFCA). In addition, recent advances in multiplex applications, high throughput arrays, miniaturisation, and enhancements using noble metal nanoparticles that promise unprecedented sensitivity to the level of single molecule detection, are discussed., In summary, while SPR is not a new technique, technological advances may see SPR quickly emerge as a highly powerful technology, enabling rapid and routine analysis of molecular interactions for a diverse range of targets, including those with clinical applicability. As the technology produces data quickly, in real-time and in a label-free environment, it may well have a significant presence in future developments in lab-on-a-chip technologies including point-of-care devices and personalised medicine.},

In this study a low flow push–pull perfusion system is introduced that provides high (70–80\%) in vitro recoveries. A concentric probe design is used with a 27-gauge stainless steel outer cannula for saline infusion and an inner fused silica capillary for fluid withdrawal. Flow rates of 10–50 nl/min were reliably generated and were well matched in vitro. Sampling was performed in the striatum of an anesthetized rat generating a 0.5 μl sample every 12 min. Capillary electrophoresis was used to determine glutamate levels in each sample; the basal level was found to be 1.97±0.70 μM. The method described was also demonstrated to deliver l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid through the perfusion solution while sampling. Post-sampling histological analysis demonstrates little tissue disturbance to the sampled region. These data provide evidence that low flow push–pull method is a viable alternative for studying neurochemical signaling in the CNS.},

	abstract = {A novel multiple monolithic fiber solid-phase microextraction (MMF-SPME) was designed and prepared. Two steps were involved in the preparation of MMF-SPME. Firstly, single thin fiber (0.5 mm in diameter) was prepared by co-polymerization of vinylimidazole and ethylene dimethacrylate. Secondly, several thin fibers were bound together to obtain the MMF assembly. The extraction and desorption dynamics of MMF-SPME with different numbers of fibers were studied in detail. In order to demonstrate the usability of the new MMF-SPME, the extraction performance of MMF-SPME for 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol was investigated in direct SPME mode. Results indicated that aqueous samples could form convection effectively within MMF-SPME because there were gaps between fibers. The extraction procedure was accelerated by the convection. At the same time, the MMF-SPME possessed high extraction capacity because more sorbent was employed. Under the optimized extraction conditions, low detection limits (S/N = 3) and quantification limits (S/N = 10) for the target analytes were achieved within the range of 0.13–0.29 μg/L and 0.44–0.98 μg/L, respectively. The MMF-SPME also showed a very long lifespan and good repeatability. Finally, the MMF-SPME was successfully applied to the analysis of tap, lake and ground water samples with spiked recoveries in the range of 73.8–101\%.},

Polyaniline (PANI) was used as an extraction phase for the comparison of extraction capacity and equilibrium extraction time of nano- and micro-structured coatings. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used as model compounds to examine the extraction properties of nano- and micro-structured coatings. The results revealed that nano-structured PANI coating showed higher extraction rate and shorter desorption time than micro-structured coating, because of the larger surface area. In order to evaluate the extraction capability of prepared nano-structured PANI coating, headspace-SPME method was used for the determination of PCBs in sediment samples by GC-electron capture detector. The proposed method was validated using the certified reference material.},

	abstract = {The shape and the surface charge of microchannels are critical parameters for ionic and mass transport in microfluidic systems. A great number of studies and developments have been carried out in order to optimize these features separately. We propose to consider them together within a new fundamental parameter for microfluidics, that we named the Volumic Surface Charge (VSC), which is the ratio of the surface charge to the section height in planar microchannels. The non-linear effects induced by rapid VSC variations can result in selective preconcentration processes, which can be used for a simultaneous preconcentration and separation of biomolecules within simple straight channels. In this review, we first present 3 different techniques that we developed to tune the VSC either by surface chemical patterning, integration of polarisable interfaces or geometrical constrictions. The proof of concept of the selective preconcentration using VSC variations will be presented on the basis of experimental results obtained with fluorescent probes and numerical simulations.},

Then a superior solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber was fabricated by sequentially coating the stainless steel fiber with silicone sealant film and mesoporous TiO2 powder. The developed fiber possessed a homogeneous surface and a long life-span up to 100 times at direct immersing (DI) extraction mode. Under the optimized conditions, the extraction efficiencies of the self-made 17 μm TiO2 fiber for six organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were higher than those of the two commercial fibers (65 μm PDMS/DVB and 85 μm PA fibers) which were much thicker than the former. As for analytical performance, low detection limits (0.08–0.60 ng L−1) and wide linearity (5–5000 ng L−1) were achieved under the optimal conditions. The repeatabilities (n = 5) for single fiber were between 2.8 and 12.3\%, while the reproducibilities (n = 3) of fiber-to-fiber were in the range of 3.7–15.7\%. The proposed fiber was successfully applied to the sensitive analysis of OCPs in real water samples and four of the six analytes were detected from the rainwater and the lake water samples.},

The porous multifiber SPME provided larger absorption capacity and higher absorption rate compared to a polymer-coated single fiber. Its absorption rate was 10 times higher than that of a commercial 100-μm poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-coated fiber. Its high extraction efficiency enabled the positive identification of unknown compounds at sub-part-per-billion level in full-scan mode with a benchtop quadruple GC/MS. The desorption temperature indicated that the analyte interactions with the C18-bonded silica were stronger than those with the PDMS polymer. The dependence of the equilibration time on the molecular weight was not observed for the porous multifiber SPME. The boundary layer between the fiber coating and the sample matrix could be the absorption control step in SPME under mild agitation. The special experimental conditions in the porous multifiber SPME, such as air interference and polar organic solvent wetting, were investigated.},

We summarize the most recent bioanalytical developments that employed NMs as effective probes using solvent microextraction in preconcentration methods coupled with MALDI-MS for assaying biomolecules from complex biological samples. We classify the nanomaterial (NM)-based miniaturized extraction/preconcentration methods into four parts: (1) nanoparticle (NP)-based single-drop microextraction; (2) NP-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction; (3) NMs as affinity and concentrating probes; and, (4) NMs as probes for bacterial analysis. We particularly emphasize efforts on NM-based miniaturized extraction and sample-preparation methods coupled with MALDI-MS for bioassays.

	abstract = {This article discusses comparison of microextraction versus exhaustive extraction approaches for simultaneous extraction of compounds in wide range of polarity at low and high volumes of sample by comparing solid phase extraction (SPE) and solid phase microextraction (SPME). Here, both systems are discussed theoretically and evaluated based on experimental data. Experimental comparisons were conducted in terms of extraction recovery, sensitivity, and selectivity for the extraction of doping agent compounds (log P: 0.14–4.98), using C18 as the extraction phase. The extraction recovery of both systems was studied at different volumes of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The distribution constant of SPME in thin-film geometry (i.e., thin-film microextraction/TFME) as well as the retention factor and breakthrough volume for the SPE system were evaluated for the simultaneous extraction of polar and non-polar compounds. Using 1 mL of sample, the extraction recovery and sensitivity of the SPE system (100 mg sorbent) was comparable with that of TFME format of SPME (15 mg sorbent) for all analytes, with the exception of most polar compounds, due to the smaller amount of the extraction phase in SPME. Breakthrough in the SPE system was observed for more polar compounds in a 25 mL sample; however, this situation did not affect the quantitation of TFME, as this technique operates in equilibrium mode. Experimental values for breakthrough volume were in good match with the calculated theoretical values. Results indicate that the microextraction approach is more suitable for untargeted determinations, where the breakthrough volume cannot be determined prior to the experiment. In addition, when both methods are at optimum conditions, findings suggest that, despite the smaller volume of the extraction phase in TFME, the sensitivity of TFME can exceed that of SPE for samples where the target analytes vary substantially in polarity.},

	abstract = {A mathematical description of all steps of sorption preconcentration in flow analysis systems is developed based on equations of material balance, mass transfer, and equilibrium distribution of micro components. The description of the sorption step allows calculation of the analyte distribution throughout the column. Further, the distribution is used as the initial boundary conditions for description of the desorption step. For practical calculation, a system of model equations is formulated and adopted to Comsol software. The numerical values of the parameters are derived from experimental data using a stepwise approximation method to achieve a minimal spread between the theoretical and experimental curves. An algorithm is developed for estimation of the confidence intervals for the parameters of the model based on the dispersion of the experimental data.},

The calibration process was carried out exposing the samplers to a continuous flow of contaminated water at 100 ng mL−1 for up to 28 days, and, consequently, the sampling rates (Rs, mL day−1) of several organic microcontaminants were provided for the first time. In situ Rs values were also determined disposing the samplers in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. Finally, these passive samplers were applied to monitor the effluents of two wastewater treatment plants. This application lead to the confirmation of the presence of galaxolide, tonalide and 4-tert-octylphenol at high ng mL−1 levels, as well as the identification of compounds like some phthalates and alkylphenols at levels below the detection limits for active sampling methods.},

A modified polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) is able to quantify aqueous PFCs. However, with varying external water velocity, PFC sampling rates (Rs) may change, affecting accuracy of derived water concentrations. To facilitate field deployment of this sampler, two methods of in-situ calibration were investigated: performance reference compounds (PRCs) and passive flow monitors (PFMs). Increased Rs's (by factors of 1.2–1.9) with PFM loss rate (g d−1) were observed for some PFCs. Results indicate PFMs can be used to correct PFC specific Rs's for more reliable estimates of environmental concentrations with a precision of about 0.01 L d−1. Empirical models presented provide an improved means for aquatic monitoring of PFCs. The PRC approach was unsuccessful, confirming concern as to its applicability with such samplers.},

Thirty laboratories participated in the sampler comparison exercise. Various samplers designs were exposed at a single sampling site to treated waste water. The organisers deployed in parallel multiple samplers of a single type, which were distributed for evaluation of the contribution of the different analytical procedures to the data variability. Between laboratory variation of results from passive samplers was about factor 5 larger than within laboratory variability. Similar results obtained for different passive samplers analysed by individual laboratories and also low within laboratory variability indicate that the passive sampling process is causing less variability than the analysis. Concentrations in composite water samples were within the range obtained by passive samplers. In future a significant improvement of analytical precision and calibration of adsorption based passive samplers is needed.},

A polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) was extensively tested to optimize its performance under both controlled and field conditions. The passive sampler was subsequently used for the sampling and analysis of estrone, 17β-estradiol, 17α-ethynylestradiol, bisphenol A, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, meberverine, thioridazine, carbamazepine, tamoxifen, indomethacine, diclofenac and meclofenamic acid in sewage effluent and river water. Under laboratory conditions, the kinetics of compound uptake by POCIS were linear during 10-day of exposure. POCIS sampling rates of the target compounds were significantly greater by using polyethersulfone instead of polysulfone membrane, and enhanced with increasing sorbent exposure area. Together with spot water sampling, the optimized POCIS was deployed in the River Ouse, West Sussex, UK to obtain field-derived sampling rates which, for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), were significantly higher than those from laboratory experiments. Both spot and passive sampling demonstrated that most of the target chemicals were frequently detected in sewage effluent and river waters, and that the daily changes in the pollutant concentrations were greater for pharmaceuticals than for EDCs. The aqueous concentrations of all compounds were elevated at a sewage outfall, which is confirmed to be an important source of the target compounds in the river. The validated POCIS was then successfully used to estimate the concentrations of the target compounds in effluent and river water, which were in good agreement with those from spot sampling for pharmaceuticals.},

DNT exhibited higher activity and durability for the photocatalytic degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde and toluene than TNT. The doubly open-ended structure of DNT allows O2 molecules to be easily supplied to the active sites, which increases not only the intrinsic photocatalytic activity but also the resistance to catalyst deactivation. The freestanding DNT film was additionally loaded with TiO2 nanoparticles (NP@DNT) in the inner wall to further increase the activity for VOC degradation. The photocatalytic activity of NP@DNT was higher than bare DNT and bare TNT by 1.3 and 1.8 times, respectively. Unlike the case of DNT, the TiO2 nanoparticles loaded TNT (NP@TNT) exhibited a lower activity than bare TNT, probably because the TiO2 nanoparticles blocked the TNT channels with hindering the mass transfer of O2 and VOC molecules. DNT with doubly open-ended structure serves as a versatile platform of fabricating nanostructured photocatalysts with maintaining the open channel structure that facilitates the mass transfer of O2 and VOC molecules.},

	abstract = {Efficient mass transport through porous networks is essential for achieving rapid response times in sensing applications utilizing porous materials. In this work, we show that open-ended porous membranes can overcome diffusion challenges experienced by closed-ended porous materials in a microfluidic environment. A theoretical model including both transport and reaction kinetics is employed to study the influence of flow velocity, bulk analyte concentration, analyte diffusivity, and adsorption rate on the performance of open-ended and closed-ended porous sensors integrated with flow cells. The analysis shows that open-ended pores enable analyte flow through the pores and greatly reduce the response time and analyte consumption for detecting large molecules with slow diffusivities compared with closed-ended pores for which analytes largely flow over the pores. Experimental confirmation of the results was carried out with open- and closed-ended porous silicon (PSi) microcavities fabricated in flow-through and flow-over sensor configurations, respectively. The adsorption behavior of small analytes onto the inner surfaces of closed-ended and open-ended PSi membrane microcavities was similar. However, for large analytes, PSi membranes in a flow-through scheme showed significant improvement in response times due to more efficient convective transport of analytes. The experimental results and theoretical analysis provide quantitative estimates of the benefits offered by open-ended porous membranes for different analyte systems.},

	abstract = {Microfluidic systems are commonly applied towards pre-concentration of biomarkers for enhancing detection sensitivity. Quantitative information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of pre-concentration, such as its position, extent, and time evolution are essential towards sensor design for coupling pre-concentration to detection. Current quantification methodologies are based on the time evolution of fluorescence signals from biomarkers within a statically defined region of interest, which does not offer information on the spatial dynamics of pre-concentration and leads to significant errors when the pre-concentration zone is delocalized or exhibits wide variations in size, shape, and position over time under the force field. We present a dynamic methodology for quantifying the region of interest by using a statistical description of particle distribution across the device geometry to determine the intensity thresholds for particle pre-concentration. This method is applied to study the delocalized pre-concentration dynamics under an electrokinetic force balance driven by negative dielectrophoresis, for aligning the pre-concentration and detection regions of neuropeptide Y, and for quantifying the polarizability dispersion of silica nano-colloids with frequency of the force field. We envision the application of this automated methodology on data from 2D images and 3D Z-stacks for quantifying pre-concentration dynamics over delocalized regions as a function of the force field.},

	abstract = {Micro/nano scale biosensors integrated with the local adsorption mask have been demonstrated to have a better limit of detection (LOD) and less sample consumptions. However, the molecular diffusions and binding kinetics in such confined droplet have been less studied which limited further development and application of the local adsorption method and imposed restrictions on discovery of new signal amplification strategies. In this work, we studied the kinetic issues via experimental investigations and theoretical analysis on microfabricated biosensors. Mass sensitive film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) sensors with hydrophobic Teflon film covering the non-sensing area as the mask were introduced. The fabricated masking sensors were characterized with physical adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and specific binding of antibody and antigen. Over an order of magnitude improvement on LOD was experimentally monitored. An analytical model was introduced to discuss the target molecule diffusion and binding kinetics in droplet environment, especially the crucial effects of incubation time, which has been less covered in previous local adsorption related literatures. An incubation time accumulated signal amplification effect was theoretically predicted, experimentally monitored and carefully explained. In addition, device optimization was explored based on the analytical model to fully utilize the merits of local adsorption. The discussions on the kinetic issues are believed to have wide implications for other types of micro/nano fabricated biosensors with potentially improved LOD.},

Lactate in normal human subjects get cleared very quickly at a rate of 320 mmol/L/hr, mostly by liver metabolism and re-conversion of lactate back to pyruvate. Measurement of lactate level in serum is required for the differential diagnosis and medical management of hyperlactatemia, cardiac arrest and resuscitation, sepsis, reduced renal excretion, hypoxia induced cancer, decreased extra hepatic metabolism, intestinal infarction and lactic acidosis. Determination of lactate is also important in dairy products and beverages to access their quality. Among the various methods available for detection of lactate, most are complicated, nonspecific, less sensitive and require time-consuming sample pretreatment, expensive instrumental set-up and trained persons to operate, specifically for chromatographic methods. Biosensing methods overcome these drawbacks, as these are simple, fast, specific and highly sensitive. Lactate biosensors reported so far, work optimally within 3–180 s, between pH, 5.5–8.5 and temperature 22 °C to 37 °C and lactate concentration ranging from 10 to 2000 µM. These biosensors have been employed to measure lactate level in embryonic cell culture, beverages, urine, and serum samples and reused upto 200-times within a period of 7–216 days. This review presents the principles, merits and demerits of various analytical methods for lactate determination with special emphasis on lactate biosensors.

	abstract = {Quantification of biological or biochemical processes are of utmost importance for medical, biological and biotechnological applications. However, converting the biological information to an easily processed electronic signal is challenging due to the complexity of connecting an electronic device directly to a biological environment. Electrochemical biosensors provide an attractive means to analyze the content of a biological sample due to the direct conversion of a biological event to an electronic signal. Over the past decades several sensing concepts and related devices have been developed. In this review, the most common traditional techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, impedance spectroscopy, and various field-effect transistor based methods are presented along with selected promising novel approaches, such as nanowire or magnetic nanoparticle-based biosensing. Additional measurement techniques, which have been shown useful in combination with electrochemical detection, are also summarized, such as the electrochemical versions of surface plasmon resonance, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy, ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance, and scanning probe microscopy., The signal transduction and the general performance of electrochemical sensors are often determined by the surface architectures that connect the sensing element to the biological sample at the nanometer scale. The most common surface modification techniques, the various electrochemical transduction mechanisms, and the choice of the recognition receptor molecules all influence the ultimate sensitivity of the sensor. New nanotechnology-based approaches, such as the use of engineered ion-channels in lipid bilayers, the encapsulation of enzymes into vesicles, polymersomes, or polyelectrolyte capsules provide additional possibilities for signal amplification., In particular, this review highlights the importance of the precise control over the delicate interplay between surface nano-architectures, surface functionalization and the chosen sensor transducer principle, as well as the usefulness of complementary characterization tools to interpret and to optimize the sensor response.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654556/},
	doi = {10.1186/1746-4811-4-28},
	abstract = {Background
Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signalling molecule in plant defenses against biotrophic pathogens. It is also involved in several other processes such as heat production, flowering, and germination. SA exists in the plant as free SA and as an inert glucose conjugate (salicylic acid 2-O-β-D-glucoside or SAG). Recently, Huang et al. developed a bacterial biosensor that responds to free SA but not SAG, designated as Acinetobacter sp. ADPWH\_lux. In this paper we describe an improved methodology for Acinetobacter sp. ADPWH\_lux-based free SA quantification, enabling high-throughput analysis, and present an approach for the quantification of SAG from crude plant extracts.

Results
On the basis of the original biosensor-based method, we optimized extraction and quantification. SAG content was determined by treating crude extracts with β-glucosidase, then measuring the released free SA with the biosensor. β-glucosidase treatment released more SA in acetate buffer extract than in Luria-Bertani (LB) extract, while enzymatic hydrolysis in either solution released more free SA than acid hydrolysis. The biosensor-based method detected higher amounts of SA in pathogen-infected plants than did a GC/MS-based method. SA quantification of control and pathogen-treated wild-type and sid2 (SA induction-deficient) plants demonstrated the efficacy of the method described. Using the methods detailed here, we were able to detect as little as 0.28 μg SA/g FW. Samples typically had a standard deviation of up to 25\% of the mean.

Conclusion
The ability of Acinetobacter sp. ADPWH\_lux to detect SA in a complex mixture, combined with the enzymatic hydrolysis of SAG in crude extract, allowed the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method to simultaneously measure free and glucose-conjugated SA. This approach is amenable to a high-throughput format, which would further reduce the cost and time required for biosensor-based SA quantification. Possible applications of this approach include characterization of enzymes involved in SA metabolism, analysis of temporal changes in SA levels, and isolation of mutants with aberrant SA accumulation.},

	abstract = {Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 is a common soil-associated bacterium with high natural competency, allowing it to efficiently integrate foreign DNA fragments into its chromosome. This property was exploited to engineer salicylate-inducible luxCDABE and green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1. Specifically, Acinetobacter sp. ADPWH\_lux displayed the higher sensitivity when comparing the two variants (minimum detection c. 0.5–1 µM salicylate) and a faster turnover of the lux marker gene, making it suitable for whole-cell luminescence assays of salicylate concentration. In contrast, the longer maturation and turnover times of the GFP protein make the Acinetobacter sp. ADPWH\_gfp variant more suited to applications involving whole-cell imaging of the presence of salicylate. The sensitivity of the luxCDABE variant was demonstrated by assaying salicylate production in naphthalene-degrading cultures. Assays using ADPWH\_lux specifically mapped the kinetics of salicylate production from naphthalene and were similar to that observed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data. However, ADPWH\_lux exhibited the higher sensitivity, when compared with HPLC, for detecting salicylate production during the first 24 h of naphthalene metabolism. These data demonstrate that the engineered Acinetobacter variants have significant potential for salicylate detection strategies in laboratory and field studies, especially in scenarios where genetic stability of the construct is required for in situ monitoring.},

	abstract = {The implementation of strict environmental quality standards for polar organic priority pollutants poses a challenge for monitoring programs. The polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) may help to address the challenge of measuring low and fluctuating trace concentrations of such organic contaminants, offering significant advantages over traditional sampling. In the present review, the authors evaluate POCIS calibration methods and factors affecting sampling rates together with reported environmental applications. Over 300 compounds have been shown to accumulate in POCIS, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones, and industrial chemicals. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler extracts have been used for both chemical and biological analyses. Several different calibration methods have been described, which makes it difficult to directly compare sampling rates. In addition, despite the fact that some attempts to correlate sampling rates with the properties of target compounds such as log KOW have been met with varying success, an overall model that can predict uptake is lacking. Furthermore, temperature, water flow rates, salinity, pH, and fouling have all been shown to affect uptake; however, there is currently no robust method available for adjusting for these differences. Overall, POCIS has been applied to a wide range of sampling environments and scenarios and has been proven to be a useful screening tool. However, based on the existing literature, a more mechanistic approach is required to increase understanding and thus improve the quantitative nature of the measurements. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {In situ extraction of steroid hormones from waste water using adsorption-based integrative passive samplers represents a promising approach for their monitoring in water at ultra-trace concentrations. Three passive samplers, namely a POCIS, a Chemcatcher fitted with an Empore SDB-RPS disk, and an Empore SDB-RPS disk-based sampler with enhanced water flow, were calibrated in situ in treated municipal wastewater for the purpose of monitoring five estrogens (17-β-estradiol, 17-α-estradiol, 17-α-ethinylestradiol, estrone and estriol) at sub ng per litre concentrations. Uptake of steroids to samplers during 14-day exposure in wastewater was compared with steroid concentrations in daily collected composite water samples. Sampling rates were obtained from a numerical solution of first order uptake kinetics equations describing the uptake of compounds into a passive sampler over time. Mass transfer of steroids in the Chemcatcher fitted with naked Empore disks was more than two times faster than in the POCIS sampler. The uptake capacity of the applied Empore disk was not sufficient for integrative uptake of all tested steroids during the entire 14-day exposure. Time-weighted average concentrations of steroids estimated at concentrations in units of ng L−1 using the in situ-calibrated samplers were within a factor of two from values obtained using composite water samples.},

	abstract = {A simple and rapid high-performance liquid chromatography method with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) using microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) during the sample preparation step was developed and validated to quantify lamotrigine (LTG) in rat plasma and brain samples. MEPS variables such as pH, number of draw-eject cycles, and washing and desorption conditions were optimized. The chromatographic resolution of LTG and chloramphenicol, used as internal standard (IS), was accomplished in less than 5 min on a C18 column, at 35 °C, using an isocratic elution with acetonitrile (13\%), methanol (13\%) and water-triethylamine (99.7:0.3, v/v; pH 6.0) pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Detection was performed at 215 nm. Calibration curves were linear over the range of 0.1–20 μg/mL (r2 ≥ 0.9947) for LTG in both rat plasma and brain homogenate samples. The intra and interday imprecision did not exceed 8.6\% and the intra and interday inaccuracy ranged from −8.1 to 13.5\%. LTG was extracted from rat plasma and brain homogenate samples with an average absolute recovery ranging from 68.0 to 86.7\%, and its stability was demonstrated in the assayed conditions. No interferences were observed at the retention times of the analyte (LTG) and IS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bioanalytical assay that uses MEPS procedure for the determination of LTG not only in rat plasma but also in tissue (brain) samples. This novel method was successfully applied to a preliminary pharmacokinetic study in rats and it seems to be a cost-effective tool to support non-clinical pharmacokinetic-based studies involving LTG treatment.},

Binding properties of MIPs were studied in comparison with their nonimprinted polymer (NIP). Ten milligrams of the optimized MIP was then evaluated as a sorbent, for preconcentration, in molecularly imprinted solid-phase microextraction (MISPME) of tramadol from aqueous solution and rabbit brain tissue. The analytical method was calibrated in the range of 0.004 ppm (4 ng mL−1) and 10 ppm (10 μg mL−1) in aqueous media and in the ranges of 0.01 and 10 ppm in rabbit brain tissue, respectively. The results indicated significantly higher binding affinity of MIPs to tramadol, in comparison with NIP. The MISPME procedure was developed and optimized with a recovery of 81.12–107.54\% in aqueous solution and 76.16–91.20\% in rabbit brain tissue. The inter- and intra-day variation values were \&lt;8.24 and 5.06\%, respectively. Finally the calibrated method was applied for determination of tramadol in real rabbit brain tissue samples after administration of a lethal dose. Our data demonstrated the potential of MISPME for rapid, sensitive and cost-effective sample analysis. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The mixed-mode (C18/strong cation exchange-SCX) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber has recently been shown to have increased sensitivity for ionic compounds compared to more conventional sampler coatings such as polyacrylate and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). However, data for structurally diverse compounds to this (prototype) sampler coating are too limited to define its structural limitations. We determined C18/SCX fiber partitioning coefficients of nineteen cationic structures without hydrogen bonding capacity besides the charged group, stretching over a wide hydrophobicity range (including amphetamine, amitriptyline, promazine, chlorpromazine, triflupromazine, difenzoquat), and eight basic pharmaceutical and illicit drugs (pKa \&gt; 8.86) with additional hydrogen bonding moieties (MDMA, atenolol, alprenolol, metoprolol, morphine, nicotine, tramadol, verapamil). In addition, sorption data for three neutral benzodiazepines (diazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam) and the anionic NSAID diclofenac were collected to determine the efficiency to sample non-basic drugs. All tested compounds showed nonlinear isotherms above 1 mmol/L coating, and linear isotherms below 1 mmol/L. The affinity for C18/SCX-SPME for tested organic cations without Hbond capacities increased with longer alkyl chains, ranging from logarithmic fiber-water distribution coefficients (log Dfw) of 1.8 (benzylamine) to 5.8 (triflupromazine). Amines smaller than benzylamine may thus have limited detection levels, while cationic surfactants with alkyl chain lengths \&gt;12 carbon atoms may sorb too strong to the C18/SCX sampler which hampers calibration of the fiber-water relationship in the linear range. The log Dfw for these simple cation structures closely correlates with the octanol-water partition coefficient of the neutral form (Kow,N), and decreases with increased branching and presence of multiple aromatic rings. Oxygen moieties in organic cations decreased the affinity for C18/SCX-SPME. Log Dfw values of neutral benzodiazepines were an order of magnitude higher than their log Kow,N. Results for anionic diclofenac species (log Kow,N 4.5, pKa 4.0, log Dfw 2.9) indicate that the C18-SCX fiber might also be useful for sampling of organic anions. This data supports our theory that C18-based coatings are able to sorb ionized compounds through adsorption and demonstrates the applicability of C18-based SPME in the measurement of freely dissolved concentrations of a wide range of ionizable compounds.},

	abstract = {Here, we report on the applicability of the C18/SCX fiber (containing both C18 and strong cation exchange groups) as a direct sampling tool in tissue. An agarose gel model was used as semi-solid tissue surrogate, to mimic changes in matrix tortuosity as expected in tissue. Pork muscle was used as tissue source and was loaded with diazepam or amitriptyline using 24 h incubation in spiked phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Diazepam is neutral and its behavior is predictable based on the octanol–water partition coefficient (Kow). Amitriptyline is \&gt;99\% positively charged at pH 7.4, and is likely to behave differently in both agarose gel and tissue compared to neutral compounds. The proposed SPME method yielded detectable fiber concentrations after direct sampling in agarose gel and loaded tissue, including short sampling times and different loading concentrations in tissue. Sorption affinity of both diazepam and amitriptyline is decreased when sampling from agarose gel compared to PBS, due to the presence of different binding groups in agarose. Sorption affinities from tissue are even further decreased compared to agarose gel. This indicates that tissue contains even more binding sites for these compounds compared to agarose gel. Interestingly, for both compounds, equilibration in tissue occurred faster than equilibration in agarose gel or PBS, most likely caused by direct fiber contact or through facilitated transport. Although more research is needed to obtain good quantitative results, these results show that the C18/SCX fiber is a sensitive tool to determine tissue concentrations of neutral and cationic compounds.},

The measured kw helped to quantitatively understand calcium sulphate transport through a poly(ethersulfone) membrane and two water boundary layers (at both sides of the membrane). Alabaster based kw were used to understand atrazine transport in the diffusion cell, allowing the conclusion that atrazine transport in the membrane is via the pore space, rather than via the polymer matrix. The merits of measuring alabaster dissolution rates for passive sampler calibration and application in the field is discussed. We propose that passive sampler calibrations be carried out under controlled kw conditions, rather than under controlled stirring rates or flow velocities. This would facilitate the interpretation of passive sampler calibration studies and the translation of laboratory based water sampling rates to flow conditions that apply in the field.

Colloids present in manure may potentially intensify the environmental risk of groundwater pollution by colloid-facilitated contaminant transport. The transport behavior of the veterinary antibiotic florfenicol in saturated homogeneously packed soil columns has been investigated in both the presence and absence of manure colloids. Results show that facilitated transport of florfenicol is significant in the presence of manure colloids. Multiple chemical and physical processes caused by the presence of manure colloids were considered to contribute to facilitated transport. Florfenicol breakthrough curves (BTCs) were fit well by two models. The two-site nonequilibrium adsorption contaminant transport model suggested the mechanisms for facilitated florfenicol transport are as follows: manure colloids decrease the sorption capacity of florfenicol to soil, enhance the instantaneous equilibrium adsorption, and suppress the time-dependent kinetic adsorption processes. The colloid-facilitated model further evaluated the partition coefficient of florfenicol to colloids and indicated that cotransport has little contribution. A stepwise inverse model fitting approach resulted in robust parameter estimation. The adoption of the nonlinear Freundlich adsorption equation in the two-site nonequilibrium model significantly increased the fit of the model to the breakthrough curves.},

	abstract = {The binding and speciation of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) in aqueous solutions were determined by controlling chemical activity and measuring total concentrations. Passive dosing was applied to control chemical activities of HOCs in aqueous solutions by equilibrium partitioning from a poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer preloaded with the chemicals. The HOC concentrations in the equilibrated solutions [C(solution(eq))] and water [C(water(eq))] were then measured. Free fractions of the HOCs were determined as C(water(eq))/C(solution(eq)), whereas enhanced capacities (E) of the solutions for HOCs were determined as C(solution(eq))/C(water(eq)). A mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons served as model analytes, while humic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, and NaCl served as model medium constituents. The enhanced capacities were plotted versus the concentrations of medium constituents, and simple linear regression provided precise partition ratios, salting out constants, and critical micelle concentrations. These parameters were generally in good agreement with published values obtained by solid phase microextraction and fluorescence quenching. The very good precision was indicated by the low relative standard errors for the partition ratios of 0.5-8\%, equivalent to 0.002-0.03 log unit. This passive dosing approach allows binding and speciation of HOCs to be studied without any phase separation steps or mass balance assumptions.},

	abstract = {In this publication, a novel solid phase microextraction (SPME) coating functionalized with a DNA aptamer for selective enrichment of a low abundance protein from diluted human plasma is described. This approach is based on the covalent immobilization of an aptamer ligand on electrospun microfibers made with the hydrophilic polymer poly(acrylonitrile-co-maleic acid) (PANCMA) on stainless steel rods. A plasma protein, human alpha-thrombin, was employed as a model protein for selective extraction by the developed Apt-SPME probe, and the detection was carried out with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The SPME probe exhibited highly selective capture, good binding capacity, high stability and good repeatability for the extraction of thrombin. The protein selective probe was employed for direct extraction of thrombin from 20-fold diluted human plasma samples without any other purification. The Apt-SPME method coupled with LC-MS/MS provided a good linear dynamic range of 0.5-50 nM in diluted human plasma with a good correlation coefficient (R(2)=0.9923), and the detection limit of the proposed method was found to be 0.30 nM. Finally, the Apt-SPME coupled with LC-MS/MS method was successfully utilized for the determination of thrombin in clinical human plasma samples. One shortcoming of the method is its reduced efficiency in undiluted human plasma compared to the standard solution. Nevertheless, this new aptamer affinity-based SPME probe opens up the possibility of selective enrichment of a given targeted protein from complex sample either in vivo or ex vivo.},

	abstract = {The presence of complex matrix in the aquatic system affects the environmental behavior of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). In the current study, an automated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) desorption method was employed to study the effect of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-HPCD) on the kinetic process of 5 selected polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) desorbing from the fiber in aqueous sample. The results showed that the added beta-HPCD facilitated the desorption rates of PAHs from SPME fiber coating, and the enhancement effect can be predicted by a proposed theoretical model. Based on this model, the kinetic parameters of organic compounds desorbing from the SPME fiber can be determined, and the calculated results showed good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, the effect of temperature on the desorption kinetic was investigated. The results found that the SPME desorption time constant increased as the sampling temperature elevated, and followed the Arrhenius equation. Also, the temperature facilitated the desorption of HOCs from the bound matrix so that increased the lability degrees of the bound compounds. Finally, a calibration method based on the proposed theoretical model was developed and applied for the analysis of unknown sample.},

	abstract = {An aqueous multicomponent mixture containing a wide range of volatility and polarity compounds (log Kow range 1.26-8.72) was used to clearly define the capabilities and limitations of headspace solid-phase microextraction in quantification of multicomponent complex samples. Commercially available fiber coatings were evaluated by investigating the extraction efficiency and desorption carryover. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry was selected to map out the differences between the coatings. The investigated components were chosen to represent several homologous groups of metabolites most frequently present in complex food and environmental samples, including straight-chain hydrocarbons, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, 2-ketones, aldehydes, ethyl esters, and terpenes. Particular emphasis was placed on examination of coating saturation and interanalyte displacements. These effects were assessed by evaluating the linear dynamic range obtained for spiked aqueous samples with divinylbenzene/Carboxen/poly(dimethylsiloxane) fiber. This coating was found to provide the optimum extraction coverage and sensitivity for the widest range of analytes. Displacement investigations were extended to apple homogenate characterized by high chemical diversity. The results indicate that interanalyte displacements are infrequent in the naturally occurring samples considered in this study. When displacements take place, they tend to occur for analytes characterized by small distribution constants, and they can be effectively detected by adding such compounds to the sample and corrected by selecting a shorter extraction time.},

	abstract = {This work aims to investigate the behavior of analytes in complex mixtures and matrixes with the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Various factors that influence analyte uptake such as coating chemistry, extraction mode, the physicochemical properties of analytes, and matrix complexity were considered. At first, an aqueous system containing analytes bearing different hydrophobicities, molecular weights, and chemical functionalities was investigated by using commercially available liquid and solid porous coatings. The differences in the mass transfer mechanisms resulted in a more pronounced occurrence of coating saturation in headspace mode. Contrariwise, direct immersion extraction minimizes the occurrence of artifacts related to coating saturation and provides enhanced extraction of polar compounds. In addition, matrix-compatible PDMS-modified solid coatings, characterized by a new morphology that avoids coating fouling, were compared to their nonmodified analogues. The obtained results indicate that PDMS-modified coatings reduce artifacts associated with coating saturation, even in headspace mode. This factor, coupled to their matrix compatibility, make the use of direct SPME very practical as a quantification approach and the best choice for metabolomics studies where wide coverage is intended. To further understand the influence on analyte uptake on a system where additional interactions occur due to matrix components, ex vivo and in vivo sampling conditions were simulated using a starch matrix model, with the aim of mimicking plant-derived materials. Our results corroborate the fact that matrix handling can affect analyte/matrix equilibria, with consequent release of high concentrations of previously bound hydrophobic compounds, potentially leading to coating saturation. Direct immersion SPME limited the occurrence of the artifacts, which confirms the suitability of SPME for in vivo applications. These findings shed light into the implementation of in vivo SPME strategies in quantitative metabolomics studies of complex plant-based systems.},

A variety of techniques have been used to study drug interactions with serum proteins, but there is still a need for faster or better methods for such work. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is one tool that has been utilized in many formats for these types of measurements. Advantages of using HPLC for this application include its speed and precision, its ability to be automated, its good limits of detection, and its compatibility with a wide range of assay formats and detectors. This review will discuss various approaches in which HPLC can be employed for the study of drug-protein interactions. These techniques include the use of soluble proteins in zonal elution and frontal analysis methods or vacancy techniques such as the Hummel-Dreyer method. Zonal elution and frontal analysis methods that make use of immobilized proteins and high-performance affinity chromatography will also be presented. A variety of applications will be examined, ranging from the determination of free drug fractions to the measurement of the strength or rate of a drug-protein interaction. Newer developments that will be discussed include recent work in the creation of novel mathematical approaches for HPLC studies of drug-protein binding, the use of HPLC methods for the high-throughput screening of drug-protein binding, and the creation and use of affinity monoliths or affinity microcolumns for examining drug-protein systems.},

Since awareness is increasing that freely dissolved concentrations in test media may change during exposure and deviate significantly from nominal concentrations there is a need for concentration monitoring in biotests. Biotests are increasingly miniaturized with effect amounts of toxicants that are close to or below quantification limits of conventional analytical methods. Thus, the suitability of pre-equilibrium non-depletive (nd) solid phase microextraction (SPME) as an analytical method for small test volumes in the presence of green algae Scenedesmus vacuolatus was investigated. The method was validated for several compounds with different physical-chemical properties and effect concentrations. Limits of quantification were at least about 10 times smaller than the EC(50) of the compounds determined in earlier studies in a cell multiplication inhibition tests with Scenedesmus vacuolatus. Fouling of the fibres due to attached algae cells could be excluded and the method was found to be well suited to measure free concentrations in the algae test. The nd-SPME-method was applied to determine partitioning coefficients between algae and the surrounding aqueous phase and can be used to determine real exposure concentrations in a cell multiplication inhibition test with green algae.},

	abstract = {Meth ods involving polyoxymethylene (POM) as a passive sampler are increasing in popularity to assess contaminant freely dissolved porewater concentrations in soils and sediments. These methods require contaminant-specific POM-water partition coefficients, KPOM . Certain methods for determining KPOM perform reproducibly (within 0.2 log units). However, other methods can give highly varying KPOM values (up to 2 log units), especially for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To account for this variation, the authors tested the influence of key methodological components in KPOM determinations, including POM thickness, extraction procedures, and environmental temperature and salinity, as well as uptake kinetics in mixed and static systems. All inconsistencies in the peer-reviewed literature can be accounted for by the likelihood that thick POM materials (500 mum or thicker) do not achieve equilibrium (causing negative biases up to 1 log unit), or that certain POM extraction procedures do not ensure quantitative extraction (causing negative biases up to 2 log units). Temperature can also influence KPOM , although all previous literature studies were carried out at room temperature. The present study found that KPOM values at room temperature are independent (within 0.2 log units) of POM manufacture method, of thickness between 17 mum and 80 mum, and of salinity between 0\% and 10\%. Regarding kinetics, monochloro- to hexachloro-polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were within 0.2 log units of equilibrium after 28 d in the mixed system, but only dichloro-PCBs achieved near equilibrium after 126 d in the static system. Based on these insights, recommended methods and KPOM values to facilitate interlaboratory reproducibility are presented.},

	abstract = {We reviewed compliance monitoring requirements in the European Union, the United States, and the Oslo-Paris Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic, and evaluated if these are met by passive sampling methods for nonpolar compounds. The strengths and shortcomings of passive sampling are assessed for water, sediments, and biota. Passive water sampling is a suitable technique for measuring concentrations of freely dissolved compounds. This method yields results that are incompatible with the EU's quality standard definition in terms of total concentrations in water, but this definition has little scientific basis. Insufficient quality control is a present weakness of passive sampling in water. Laboratory performance studies and the development of standardized methods are needed to improve data quality and to encourage the use of passive sampling by commercial laboratories and monitoring agencies. Successful prediction of bioaccumulation based on passive sampling is well documented for organisms at the lower trophic levels, but requires more research for higher levels. Despite the existence of several knowledge gaps, passive sampling presently is the best available technology for chemical monitoring of nonpolar organic compounds. Key issues to be addressed by scientists and environmental managers are outlined.},

	abstract = {Aqueous micropollutants such as estradiol can have a large environmental impact—even at low concentrations. Part of understanding this impact involves determining the extent to which the micropollutants interact with macromolecules in water. In environmental samples, relevant macromolecules to which micropollutants bind are referred to as dissolved organic matter, and the most common examples of these in freshwater and coastal seawater are fulvic and humic acids. In living organisms, the most common macromolecules that affect bioavailability of a drug (or toxin) are proteins such as albumin. Using [2, 4, 6, 7 – 3H]estradiol as an example compound, this protocol uses solid-phase microextraction and scintillation detection as analytical tools to quantify the amount of radiolabeled micropollutant available in solution. The measured free concentration after exposure to various concentrations of macromolecule (dissolved organic matter or protein) or micropollutant is used to determine the partition coefficient in the case of micropollutant–macromolecule interactions. The calibration and preparatory studies take at least 8 d, and the steps to determine the partition coefficient can be completed within 3 d. The protocol could be modified such that nonlabeled compounds are studied; instead of detection of activity by a liquid scintillation counter (LSC), the compounds can be quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) or liquid chromatography (LC)–MS(/MS).},

The rate of dissociation of metal-NOM complexes will impact the amount of free metal available for biouptake. Assessing the bioavailability of plutonium (Pu) helps to predict its toxic effects on aquatic biota. However, the rate of dissociation of Pu-NOM complexes in natural freshwaters is currently unknown. Here, we used the technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) with several diffusive layer thicknesses to provide new insights into the dissociation kinetics of Pu-NOM complexes. Results show that Pu complexes with NOM (mainly fulvic acid) are somewhat labile (0.2 {\textless}/= xi {\textless}/= 0.4), with kd = 7.5 x 10(-3) s(-1). DGT measurements of environmental Pu in organic-rich natural water confirm these findings. In addition, we determined the effective diffusion coefficients of Pu(V) in polyacrylamide (PAM) gel in the presence of humic acid using a diffusion cell (D = 1.70 +/- 0.25 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1)). These results show that Pu(V) is a more mobile species than Pu(IV).},

	abstract = {Many important environmental contaminants are hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), which include PCBs, PAHs, PBDEs, DDT and other chlorinated insecticides, among others. Owing to their strong hydrophobicity, HOCs have their final destination in soil or sediment, where their ecotoxicological effects are closely regulated by sorption and thus bioavailability. The last two decades have seen a dramatic increase in research efforts in developing and applying partitioning based methods and biomimetic extractions for measuring HOC bioavailability. However, the many variations of both analytical methods and associated measurement endpoints are often a source of confusion for users. In this review, we distinguish the most commonly used analytical approaches based on their measurement objectives, and illustrate their practical operational steps, strengths and limitations using simple flowcharts. This review may serve as guidance for new users on the selection and use of established methods, and a reference for experienced investigators to identify potential topics for further research.},

	abstract = {Binding to serum albumin has a strong influence on freely dissolved, unbound concentrations of chemicals in vivo and in vitro. For neutral organic solutes, previous studies have suggested a log-log correlation between the albumin-water partition coefficient and the octanol-water partition coefficient (K(ow)) and postulated highly nonspecific binding that is mechanistically analogous to dissolution into solvents. These relationships and concepts were further explored in this study. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-water partition coefficients (K(BSA/w)) were measured for 83 structurally diverse neutral organic chemicals in consistent experimental conditions. The correlation between log K(BSA/w) and log K(ow) was moderate, with R(2) = 0.76 and SD = 0.43. The log K(BSA/w) of low-polarity compounds including a series of chlorobenzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased with log K(ow) linearly up to log K(ow) = 4-5, but then the linear relationship apparently broke off, and the increase became gradual. The fitting of polyparameter linear free energy relationship models with five solute descriptors was just comparable to that of the log K(ow) model (R(2) = 0.78-0.79, SD = 0.41-0.42); the relatively high SD obtained suggests that solvent dissolution models are not capable of modeling albumin binding accurately. A size limitation of the binding site(s) of albumin is suggested as a possible reason for the high SD. An equilibrium distribution model indicates that serum albumin generally has high contributions to the binding in the serum of polar compounds and relatively small low-polarity compounds, whereas albumin binding for large low-polarity compounds is outcompeted by the strong partitioning into lipids due to low relative affinity of albumin for these compounds.},

	abstract = {The implementation of strict environmental quality standards for polar organic priority pollutants poses a challenge for monitoring programs. The polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) may help to address the challenge of measuring low and fluctuating trace concentrations of such organic contaminants, offering significant advantages over traditional sampling. In the present review, the authors evaluate POCIS calibration methods and factors affecting sampling rates together with reported environmental applications. Over 300 compounds have been shown to accumulate in POCIS, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones, and industrial chemicals. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler extracts have been used for both chemical and biological analyses. Several different calibration methods have been described, which makes it difficult to directly compare sampling rates. In addition, despite the fact that some attempts to correlate sampling rates with the properties of target compounds such as log K(OW) have been met with varying success, an overall model that can predict uptake is lacking. Furthermore, temperature, water flow rates, salinity, pH, and fouling have all been shown to affect uptake; however, there is currently no robust method available for adjusting for these differences. Overall, POCIS has been applied to a wide range of sampling environments and scenarios and has been proven to be a useful screening tool. However, based on the existing literature, a more mechanistic approach is required to increase understanding and thus improve the quantitative nature of the measurements.},

	abstract = {The reaction kinetics of antigen-antibody binding in the electrokinetically controlled microfluidic heterogeneous immunoassays has been investigated by numerical simulations. A two-dimensional computational model was employed to include the mass transport (convection and diffusion) and binding reaction between the antigen in the bulk flow and the immobilized antibody at the channel surface. The influence of the bulk velocity, the concentrations of the antibody and antigen, and the geometry of the microchips was studied for a variation of conditions and the guidance for designing of microfluidic immunoassay was provided. The model also shows that electrokinetically driven immunoassays have better reaction kinetics than pressure-driven ones, resulting from the plug-like velocity profile. Finally, a multi-patch immunoassay chip was analyzed and the reaction kinetics was optimized by rearranging the reaction patches at the channel surfaces.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The state of the art of passive water sampling of (nonpolar) organic contaminants is presented. Its suitability for regulatory monitoring is discussed, with an emphasis on the information yielded by passive sampling devices (PSDs), their relevance and associated uncertainties. Almost all persistent organic pollutants (POPs) targeted by the Stockholm Convention are nonpolar or weakly polar, hydrophobic substances, making them ideal targets for sampling in water using PSDs. Widely used nonpolar PSDs include semi-permeable membrane devices, low-density polyethylene and silicone rubber. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The inter-laboratory variation of equilibrium partition constants between PSD and water is mostly 0.2-0.5 log units, depending on the exact matrix used. The sampling rate of PSDs is best determined by using performance reference compounds during field deployment. The major advantage of PSDs over alternative matrices applicable in trend monitoring (e.g. sediments or biota) is that the various sources of variance including analytical variance and natural environmental variance can be much better controlled, which in turn results in a reduction of the number of analysed samples required to obtain results with comparable statistical power. CONCLUSION: Compliance checking with regulatory limits and analysis of temporal and spatial contaminant trends are two possible fields of application. In contrast to the established use of nonpolar PSDs, polar samplers are insufficiently understood, but research is in progress to develop PSDs for the quantitative assessment of polar waterborne contaminants. In summary, PSD-based monitoring is a mature technique for the measurement of aqueous concentrations of apolar POPs, with a well-defined accuracy and precision.},

	abstract = {Furan may be formed in food under heat treatment and is highly suspected to appear in indoor air. The possible exposure to indoor furan raises concerns because it has been found to cause carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity in animals. To determine airborne furan, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique was utilised as a diffusive sampler. The Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS, 75 μm) fibre was used, and the SPME fibre assembly was inserted into a polytetrafluoroethene tubing. Furan of known concentrations was generated in Tedlar gas bags for the evaluation of SPME diffusive samplers. After sampling, the sampler was inserted into the injection port of a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for thermal desorption and analysis. Validation of the SPME device with active sampling by charcoal tube was performed side by side as well. The charcoal tube was desorbed by acetone before analysis with GC/MS. The experimental sampling constant of the sampler was found equal to (9.93 ± 1.28) × 10−3 (cm3 min−1) at 25°C. Furthermore, side-by-side validations between SPME device and charcoal tube showed linear relationship with r = 0.9927. The designed passive sampling device for furan has the advantages of both passive sampling and SPME technique and looks suitable for assessing indoor air quality.},

	abstract = {This paper characterizes the potential of novel hexameric peptide ligands for on-line IgG detection in bioprocesses. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to study the binding of human IgG to the hexameric peptide ligand HWRGWV, which was covalently grafted to alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAM) on gold surfaces. Peptide coupling on SAMs was verified, followed by covalent grafting of peptides with a removable Fmoc or acetylated N-termini via their C-termini to produce active peptide SPR sensors that were tested for IgG binding. The dynamics and extent of peptide-IgG binding were compared with results from a conventional system using protein A attached on a gold surface via disulfide monolayers. IgG binding to protein A on disulfide monolayers yielded equilibrium dissociation constants of 1.4x10(-7)M. The corresponding dissociation constant value for the acetylated version of the peptide (Ac-HWRGWV) supported on alkanethiol SAM was 5.8x10(-7)M and that for HWRGWV on the alkanethiol SAM (after de-protection of Fmoc-HWRGWVA) was 1.2x10(-6)M. Maximum IgG binding capacities, Qm of 6.7, 3.8, and 4.1mgm(-2) were determined for the protein A and the two forms of HWRGWV-based biosensors, respectively. Real-time data for the kinetics of adsorption were used to determine the apparent rate constants for adsorption and desorption. The results were analyzed to understand the mechanism of IgG binding to the protein and peptide ligands. It was found that the peptide-IgG binding was reaction controlled, however the protein A-IgG binding mechanism was partially mass transfer (diffusion) controlled. The adsorption rate constants, ka, for the protein A ligand increased with decreasing concentration of analyte and the peptide ligand ka values was constant at different IgG concentrations and flow rates.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic tools which screen the binding interactions of a protein target against a display of biomolecular probes to identify molecules which bind the target are central to cell proteomic studies, and to diagnostic assays. Here, we study a microfluidic design for screening interactions in which the probe molecules are hosted on microbeads sequestered in wells arranged at the bottom of a microfluidic flow channel. Assays are undertaken by streaming an analyte solution with a fluorescently labelled target through the cell, and identifying the fluorescing beads. Numerical simulations are first constructed for the analyte flow over the microbeads in the well array, and the increase in the target concentration on the microbead surface. The binding profile is expressed as a function of the ratio of the convective to the diffusive transport rates (Peclet number or Pe), and the ratio of the kinetic to the diffusive rates (Damkohler number, Da). For any Pe, as Da becomes small enough, the transport is determined by the intrinsic kinetic binding rate. As Pe increases, a thin concentration boundary layer develops over the top surface of the microbead because of the convective flow, and target binds more rapidly. However, the relatively stagnant layers of liquid in the well provide a diffusion barrier which slows the target transport, and for any Da and Pe the transport is slower than equivalent patches of probes arranged on the channel wall. Experiments are also undertaken at high Pe, using the binding of fluorescently labelled NeutrAvidin as a target to probes of its binding partner, biotin, on the microbead surface. The binding profile is compared to the simulations to measure the kinetic rate constant, and this comparison shows that the transport in the cell is not kinetically limited because of the diffusion barriers created by the stagnant liquid layer in the well. Simulations and experiments on microbeads which are only partially recessed in the well demonstrate an increase in the mass transfer rate as more of the microbead surface intersects the flow and the diffusion limitation due to the stagnant layer of liquid surrounding the bottom part of the microbead is minimized.},

	abstract = {Affinity-based biosensing systems have become an important analytical tool for the detection and study of numerous biomolecules. The merging of these sensing technologies with microfluidic flow cells allows for faster detection times, increased sensitivities, and lower required sample volumes. In order to obtain a higher degree of performance from the sensor, it is important to know the effects of the flow cell geometry on the sensor sensitivity. In these sensors, the sensor sensitivity is related to the overall diffusive flux of analyte to the sensing surface; therefore increases in the analyte flux will be manifested as an increase in sensitivity, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD). Here we present a study pertaining to the effects of the flow cell height H on the analyte flux J, where for a common biosensor design we predict that the analyte flux will scale as J approximately H(-2/3). We verify this scaling behavior via both numerical simulations as well as an experimental surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. We show the reduction of the flow cell height can have drastic effects on the sensor performance, where the LOD of our experimental system concerning the detection of ssDNA decreases by a factor of 4 when H is reduced from 47 mum to 7 mum. We utilize these results to discuss the applicability of this scaling behavior with respect to a generalized affinity-based biosensor.},

	abstract = {This manuscript surveys the literature on passive sampler methods (PSMs) used in contaminated sediments to assess the chemical activity of organic contaminants. The chemical activity in turn dictates the reactivity and bioavailability of contaminants in sediment. Approaches to measure specific binding of compounds to sediment components, for example, amorphous carbon or specific types of reduced carbon, and the associated partition coefficients are difficult to determine, particularly for native sediment. Thus, the development of PSMs that represent the chemical activity of complex compound-sediment interactions, expressed as the freely dissolved contaminant concentration in porewater (Cfree ), offer a better proxy for endpoints of concern, such as reactivity, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Passive sampling methods have estimated Cfree using both kinetic and equilibrium operating modes and used various polymers as the sorbing phase, for example, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene, and polyoxymethylene in various configurations, such as sheets, coated fibers, or vials containing thin films. These PSMs have been applied in laboratory exposures and field deployments covering a variety of spatial and temporal scales. A wide range of calibration conditions exist in the literature to estimate Cfree , but consensus values have not been established. The most critical criteria are the partition coefficient between water and the polymer phase and the equilibrium status of the sampler. In addition, the PSM must not appreciably deplete Cfree in the porewater. Some of the future challenges include establishing a standard approach for PSM measurements, correcting for nonequilibrium conditions, establishing guidance for selection and implementation of PSMs, and translating and applying data collected by PSMs.},

	abstract = {Passive sampling is a well-established methodology for the evaluation of exposures to environmental volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique is a reliable means of sampling VOCs in air. SPME is also being applied as a passive sampler to determine time-weighted average exposure. The use of SPME as a diffusive sampler was evaluated. The passive sampler is based on the use of a cylindrical diffusion cell (porous hydrophobic polyethylene) with an 80 μm carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber to obtain radial diffusion of the analytes to the sorbent. Standard atmospheres of organic vapors in air were used to determine the experimental uptake rates for toluene and chlorobenzene. Toluene concentrations between 2 and 38 mg/m3 with sampling times between 15 and 60 min were evaluated, as well as chlorobenzene concentrations between 2 and 47 mg/m3 with sampling times between 30 and 60 min. The mean diffusive uptake rate was 2.14 mL/min for toluene and 2.57 mL/min for chlorobenzene, and no statistical significant effects of concentration and sampling time were observed under the studied conditions for the two compounds. Relative standard deviation ranged from 2.6 to 6.5\%. The performance of the sampler under varying concentrations of toluene was also tested, showing that the sampler reflects the average exposure concentration. Effects of temperature, relative humidity, velocity of the air, back diffusion, competitive adsorption, and the stability of chlorobenzene in the sampler were also studied. Sampler behavior was tested in gas stations, and the results were successfully compared with a 3M-3500 diffusive sampler. The results are promising for using this new SPME device for diffusive monitoring for occupational exposure assessment.},

Current efforts to develop and apply protective, science-based sediment quality regulations for impaired waterbodies are hampered by non-concordance between model predictions and measured bioaccumulation and toxicity. A passive sampler incorporating commercially available solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers was employed in lab and field studies to measure the freely dissolved concentration of target HOCs (Cfree) and determine its suitability as a proxy for bioaccumulation. SPME deduced Cfree for organochlorines was highly correlated with tissue concentrations (Cb) of Macoma and Nereis spp. co-exposed in laboratory microcosms containing both spiked and naturally contaminated sediments. This positive association was also observed in situ for endemic bivalves, where SPME samplers were deployed for up to 1 month at an estuarine field site. The concordance between Cb and Cfree for PAH was more variable, in part due to likely biotransformation by model invertebrates. These results indicate that SPME passive samplers can serve as a proxy for bioaccumulation of sediment-associated organochlorines in both lab and field studies, reducing the uncertainty associated with model predictions that do not adequately account for differential bioavailability.},

	abstract = {Label-free optical biosensors based on integrated photonic devices have demonstrated sensitive and selective detection of biological analytes. Integrating these sensor platforms into microfluidic devices reduces the required sample volume and enables rapid delivery of sample to the sensor surface, thereby improving response times. Conventionally, these devices are embedded in or adjacent to the substrate; therefore, the effective sensing area lies within the slow-flow region at the floor of the channel, reducing the efficiency of sample delivery. Recently, a suspended waveguide sensor was developed in which the device is elevated off of the substrate and the sensing region does not rest on the substrate. This geometry places the sensing region in the middle of the parabolic velocity profile, reduces the distance that a particle must travel by diffusion to be detected, and allows binding to both surfaces of the sensor. We use a finite element model to simulate advection, diffusion, and specific binding of interleukin 6, a signaling protein, to this waveguide-based biosensor at a range of elevations within a microfluidic channel. We compare the transient performance of these suspended waveguide sensors with that of traditional planar devices, studying both the detection threshold response time and the time to reach equilibrium. We also develop a theoretical framework for predicting the behavior of these suspended sensors. These simulation and theoretical results provide a roadmap for improving sensor performance and minimizing the amount of sample required to make measurements.},

	abstract = {A new sampling method was developed for a simple and fast evaluation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted at trace levels from building materials. The device involves an emission cell coupled with solid phase microextraction (SPME) for diffusive sampling. Owing to possible competitive adsorption of VOCs onto the PDMS-Carboxen fiber used, the co-adsorption conditions were determined through kinetics study of isolated and in mixture compounds. Hence, the linear concentration ranges which ensure reliable quantification were determined from 4.8 to 10mgm(-3)min according to the VOC studied. Thus, the analyst can select the extraction time that fits for his best analytical objectives. For example, sub microgm(-3) limits of detection can be achieved for GC-MS analysis for 20min extraction. On the other hand, 5min sampling is sufficient for a rapid screening of the major emitted VOCs, since the average limit of quantification reaches 20microgm(-3) for GC-FID analysis.},

In this review recent achievements and new perspectives on protein adsorption processes are comprehensively discussed. The main focus is put on commonly postulated mechanistic aspects and their translation into mathematical concepts and model descriptions. Relevant experimental and computational strategies to practically approach the field of protein adsorption mechanisms and their impact on current successes are outlined.},

A sensitive, selective, and reproducible immunoaffinity in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (in-tube SPME/LC-MS) method was developed, and validated for fluoxetine analysis in human serum. Important factors in the optimization of in-tube SPME variables, as well as the evaluation of the immunoaffinity capillary capacity are discussed. The in-tube SPME/LC-MS method presented a limit of quantitation of 5.00 ng/mL, and precision intra-assays with RSDs lower than 5\%. The response of the in-tube SPME/LC-MS method for fluoxetine was linear over a dynamic range from 5.00 to 50.00 ng/mL, with correlation coefficients better than 0.998. Based on analytical validation it was demonstrated that in-tube SPME/LC-MS method offers high sensitivity, selectivity, and enough reproducibility to permit the quantification of fluoxetine in human serum at therapeutic levels. Thus, the proposed SPME/LC method can be useful tool to determine fluoxetine serum concentrations in patients receiving therapeutic dosages.},

	abstract = {An electric drill coupled with a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber or a PDMS thin film was used for rapid sampling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in aqueous samples. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the sampling rates of SPME fiber and thin film can be predicted theoretically. Compared with the SPME fiber, the PDMS thin film active sampler exhibited a higher sampling rate and much better sensitivity due to its higher surface-to-volume ratio and its larger extraction phase volume. The amount of the analytes extracted by the thin film was around 100 times higher than those obtained by fiber, for both 5 min rapid sampling and equilibrium extraction. A new thin film active sampler was then developed for rapid on-site water sampling. The sampling kit included a portable electric drill, a copper mesh pocket, a piece of thin film, and a liner. Laboratory experiments indicated that the sampling remained in the linear uptake phase with this sampler to 8 min for the PAHs. Field test illustrated that this novel sampler was excellent for rapid on-site water sampling due to its short sampling period, high sampling efficiency and durability The thin film sampling kit facilitates on-site sampling, sample preparation, storage and transport. This new sampler is more user-friendly and easier to commercialize than previous samplers.},

Our results confirm the findings of previous simplified approaches that a concentration wave is created for sufficiently long microreactors. An analytical solution, developed for the wave propagation speed, shows that, when normalizing with the fluid mean velocity, it becomes a function of three parameters comprising the channel aspect ratio, the relative adsorption capacity, and the kinetic equilibrium constant. Our studies also reveal that the reactor geometry idealized as a slit, instead of a rectangular shape, gives rise to the underestimation of the saturation time. The extent of this underestimation increases by increasing the Damkohler number or decreasing the dimensionless Debye-Huckel parameter. Moreover, increasing the values of the Damkohler number, the dimensionless Debye-Huckel parameter, the relative adsorption capacity, and the velocity scale ratio results in lower saturation times.},

	abstract = {Using numerical simulation of diffusion inside diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) samplers, we show that the effect of lateral diffusion inside the sampler on the solute flux into the sampler is a nonlinear function of the diffusion layer thickness and the physical sampling window size. In contrast, earlier work concluded that this effect was constant irrespective of parameters of the sampler geometry. The flux increase caused by lateral diffusion inside the sampler was determined to be approximately 8.8\% for standard samplers, which is considerably lower than the previous estimate of approximately 20\%. Lateral diffusion is also propagated to the diffusive boundary layer (DBL), where it leads to a slightly stronger decrease in the mass uptake than suggested by the common 1D diffusion model that is applied for evaluating DGT results. We introduce a simple correction procedure for lateral diffusion and demonstrate how the effect of lateral diffusion on diffusion in the DBL can be accounted for. These corrections often result in better estimates of the DBL thickness (delta) and the DGT-measured concentration than earlier approaches and will contribute to more accurate concentration measurements in solute monitoring in waters.},

Information on the kinetics of these drug interactions with HSA would be valuable in understanding the pharmacokinetic behavior of these drugs and could provide data that might lead to the creation of improved assays for these analytes in biological samples. In this report, an approach based on peak profiling was used with high-performance affinity chromatography to measure the dissociation rate constants for carbamazepine and imipramine with HSA. This approach compared the elution profiles for each drug and a non-retained species on an HSA column and control column over a board range of flow rates. Various approaches for the corrections of non-specific binding between these drugs and the support were considered and compared in this process. Dissociation rate constants of 1.7 (+/-0.2) s(-1) and 0.67 (+/-0.04) s(-1) at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C were estimated by this approach for HSA in its interactions with carbamazepine and imipramine, respectively. These results gave good agreement with rate constants that have determined by other methods or for similar solute interactions with HSA. The approach described in this report for kinetic studies is not limited to these particular drugs or HSA but can also be extended to other drugs and proteins.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) enhances the mass transfer of hydrophobic organic compounds from nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) into the aqueous phase above that attributable to dissolved molecular diffusion alone was tested. In controlled experiments, mass transfer rates of five NAPL-phase PAHs (log K(OW) 4.15-5.39) into the aqueous phase containing different concentrations of DOC were measured. Mass transfer rates were increased by up to a factor of 4 in the presence of DOC, with the greatest enhancement being observed for more hydrophobic compounds and highest DOC concentrations. These increases could not be explained by dissolved molecular diffusion alone, and point to a parallel DOC-mediated diffusive pathway. The nature of the DOC-mediated diffusion pathway as a function of the DOC concentration and PAH sorption behavior to the DOC was investigated using diffusion-based models. The DOC-enhanced mass transfer of NAPL-phase hydrophobic compounds into the aqueous phase has important implications for their bioremediation as well as bioconcentration and toxicity.},

During the immunoassay, characteristic diffusion and kinetic time scales and determine the time for molecular diffusion of proteins secreted from the activated single lymphocytes and subsequent binding onto the glass slide surface respectively. Our results demonstrate that molecular diffusion plays important roles in the early stage of protein adsorption dynamics which shifts to a kinetic controlled mechanism in the later stage. Similar dynamic pathways are observed for protein adsorption with significantly fast rates and rapid shifts in transport mechanisms when is increased a hundred times from 0.313 to 31.3. Theoretical adsorption isotherms follow the trend of experimentally obtained data. Adsorption isotherms indicate that amount of proteins secreted from individual cells and subsequently captured on a clean glass slide surface increases monotonically with time. Our study directly validates that protein secretion rates can be quantified by the microengraving immunoassay. This will enable us to apply microengraving immunoassays to quantify secretion rates from 10(4)-10(5) single cells in parallel, screen antigen-specific cells with the highest secretion rate for clonal expansion and quantitatively reveal cellular heterogeneity within a small cell sample.},

	abstract = {Many techniques rely on the binding activity of surface-immobilized proteins, including antibody-based affinity biosensors for the detection of analytes, immunoassays, protein arrays, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors for the study of thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of protein interactions. To study the functional homogeneity of the surface sites and to characterize their binding properties, we have recently proposed a computational tool to determine the distribution of affinity and kinetic rate constants from surface binding progress curves. It is based on modeling the experimentally measured binding signal as a superposition of signals from binding to sites spanning a range of rate and equilibrium constants, with regularization providing the most parsimonious distribution consistent with the data. In the present work, we have expanded the scope of this approach to include a compartment-like transport step, which can describe competitive binding to different surface sites in a zone of depleted analyte close to the sensor surface. This approach addresses a major difficulty in the analysis of surface binding where both transport limitation as well as unknown surface site heterogeneity may be present. In addition to the kinetic binding parameters of the ensemble of surface sites, it can provide estimates for effective transport rate constants. Using antibody-antigen interactions as experimental model systems, we studied the effects of the immobilization matrix and of the analyte flow-rate on the effective transport rate constant. Both were experimentally observed to influence mass transport. The approximate description of mass transport by a compartment model becomes critical when applied to strongly transport-controlled data, and we examined the limitations of this model. In the presence of only moderate mass transport limitation the compartment model provides a good description, but this approximation breaks down for strongly transport-limited surface binding. In the latter regime, we report experimental evidence for the formation of gradients within the sensing volume of the evanescent field biosensor used.},

To study the effects of DOM on biodegradation, we used phenanthrene and pyrene as model PAHs, soil humic acids as model DOM and a soil Mycobacterium strain as a representative degrader organism. Humic acids enhanced the biodegradation of pyrene when present as solid crystals but not when initially dissolved or provided by partitioning from a polymer. Synchronous fluorescence spectrophotometry, scintillation counting and a microscale diffusion technique were applied in order to determine the kinetics of dissolution and diffusive mass transfer of pyrene. We suggest that humic acids can enhance or inhibit biodegradation as a result of the balance of two opposite effects, namely, solubilization of the chemicals on the one hand and inhibition of cell adhesion to the pollutant source on the other.},

The present work developed a novel solid phase microextraction (SPME) method for time weighted average determination of epichlorohydrin in the air by GC/MS. CAR/PDMS in 0.5 cm retracted mode was selected and the effect of environmental parameters on sampling properties of SPME was examined. Experimental sampling rate for epichlorohydrin (8.89 × 10−3 cm3/min) was slightly less than theoretical value (9.059 × 10−3 cm3/min). There was no significant difference among sampling rates at different temperature and velocities but relative humidity had a significant effect on the sampling rate. Limit of detection for SPME method was 0.8 ng per sample, which is good enough in comparison with the NIOSH 1010 method. Comparison of the results between the developed SPME and the NIOSH 1010 method on standard test atmosphere and field showed satisfactory agreement (y = 1.162x + 1.8 r 2 = 0.992 and y = 1.009x+0.76 r 2 = 0.98 respectively).},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has been demonstrated to be useful for in vivo sampling in pharmacokinetic studies. In this study, a single time-point kinetic calibration for in vivo dynamic monitoring was developed by simplification of the laborious multiple time-point kinetic calibration, based on the independent desorption kinetics of the preloaded standards from SPME fibers with the changing analyte concentrations. The theoretical foundation and practical application conditions, such as the replicate numbers, the optimal time-point for desorption, and the sampling time, were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of using regular standards rather than deuterated ones for the kinetic calibration was justified by comparing to the data obtained using the deuterated standards. All the methods were verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results from in vivo SPME were validated by the blood drawing and chemical assay. These simplified calibration methods improved the quantitative applications of SPME for dynamic monitoring and in vivo sampling, enhance the multiplexing capability and automatic potentials for high throughput analysis, and decrease expenses on reagents and instruments.},

Several drugs were examined that are known to bind to HSA. Various conditions to optimize in the use of ultrafast affinity extraction for equilibrium and kinetic studies were considered, and several approaches for these measurements were examined. The dissociation rate constants obtained for soluble HSA with each drug gave good agreement with previous rate constants reported for the same drugs or other solutes with comparable affinities for HSA. The equilibrium constants that were determined also showed good agreement with the literature. The results demonstrated that ultrafast affinity extraction could be used as a rapid approach to provide information on both the kinetics and thermodynamics of a drug-protein interaction in solution.

It is therefore highly important to estimate drug-binding ability to these macromolecules in the early stages of drug discovery and in clinical practice. Traditionally, equilibrium dialysis is used, and is presented as the reference method, but it suffers from many drawbacks. In an attempt to circumvent these, a vast array of different methods has been developed. This review focuses on the most important approaches used to characterize drug-protein binding. A description of the principle of each method with its inherent strengths and weaknesses is outlined. The binding affinity ranges, information accessibility, material consumption, and throughput are compared for each method.

	abstract = {To improve selectivity during sample pretreatment, various selective tools inducing a molecular recognition mechanism during the extraction procedure have been developed, such as sorbents constituted of immobilized antibodies, i.e., immunosorbents, or molecularly imprinted polymers. More recently, as an alternative to both previous approaches, aptamers immobilized onto a solid support, i.e., oligosorbents, were proposed. Thanks to the high affinity and high selectivity of the interaction that some aptamers offer toward some target analytes, they also provide powerful techniques that make selective extraction and the concentration of a target analyte from liquid matrices in one step or sample purification of extracts from solid matrices possible. This review describes the development and the properties of these oligosorbents developed for different types of targets-pharmaceuticals, mycotoxins, proteins, cells, etc. After describing the immobilization procedures, we discuss different parameters characterizing the potential of aptamer-based supports as extraction sorbents. Close relations exist between extraction recoveries and the affinity and amounts of aptamers immobilized on the extraction device. In addition, analyte-aptamer interactions may be affected by matrix components and by additives in the samples. This may also lower extraction recoveries and affect the stability and the possible reusability of the aptamer-based sorbent. All these points are discussed and illustrated. Numerous examples of applications of these sorbents to the treatment of complex samples such as food samples, environmental samples, and biological fluids are also reported. Their association with analytical devices, from conventional to miniaturized analytical systems, is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Integrative sampling enables the collection of analyte mass from environmental liquids over extended timeframes from hours to months. While the incentives to complement or replace conventional, time-discrete sampling have been widely discussed, the data quality implications of employing alternative, integrative methods have not yet been systematically studied. A critical analysis of contemporary literature reports showed the data quality of integrative samplers, whether active-advection or passive-diffusion, to be governed by uncertainty in both sampling rate and analyte recovery. Derivation of two lumped parameters, representing the coefficient of accumulation (alpha) of a contaminant from an environmental fluid and the coefficient of subsequent recovery (rho) of its mass from the sampler, produced a conceptual framework for quantifying error sources in concentration data derived from accumulative samplers. Whereas the precision associated with recovery was found to be fairly consistent across eight passive-diffusion and active-advection devices (averaging 5-16\% relative standard deviation, RSD), active-advection samplers effectively improve precision in sampling rate (analyte uptake), as determined for two active-advection devices (2-7\% average RSD) and five passive devices (12-42\% average RSD). In summary, an approach is presented whereby the data quality implications of integrative sampler design can be compared, which can inform the selection, optimization, and development of sampling systems to complement the state of the art.},

	abstract = {Biologically active compounds constitute a wide group of chemicals, therefore it is a big challenge to create sorbents that are sensitive as well as selective. Development of nanoporous sorbents based on conducting polymers has expanded the boundaries of detection and quantification. Additionally, electrochemical synthesis used to deposit polymeric coatings directly on solid supports makes it possible to control physico-chemical properties of such sorbents. Besides the development of new polymeric nanoporous materials, the question of selectivity needs to be addressed. One possibility, successfully adapted to solid-phase microextraction, is molecular imprinting. Coatings created with this technology allow obtaining higher selectivity, with sensitivity at a constantly high level. The main aim of this review is to present comprehensively the concept of nanoporous sorbents based on conducting polymers, possible coating methods with their characteristics, and their various applications. This article focuses on applications in environmental and biomedical analyses.},

	abstract = {The mathematical modelling underlying passive air sampling theory can be based on mass transfer coefficients or rate constants. Generally, these models have not been inter-related. Starting with basic models, the exchange of chemicals between the gaseous phase and the sampler is developed using mass transfer coefficients and rate constants. Importantly, the inter-relationships between the approaches are demonstrated by relating uptake rate constants and loss rate constants to mass transfer coefficients when either sampler-side or air-side resistance is dominating chemical exchange. The influence of sampler area and sampler volume on chemical exchange is discussed in general terms and as they relate to frequently used parameters such as sampling rates and time to equilibrium. Where air-side or sampler-side resistance dominates, an increase in the surface area of the sampler will increase sampling rates. Sampling rates are not related to the sampler/air partition coefficient (K(SV)) when air-side resistance dominates and increase with K(SV) when sampler-side resistance dominates.},

	abstract = {The current work presents the optimization of a protocol enabling direct extraction of avocado samples by a new Solid Phase Microextraction matrix compatible coating. In order to further extend the coating life time, pre-desorption and post-desorption washing steps were optimized for solvent type, time, and degree of agitation employed. Using optimized conditions, lifetime profiles of the coating related to extraction of a group of analytes bearing different physical-chemical properties were obtained. Over 80 successive extractions were carried out to establish coating efficiency using PDMS/DVB 65µm commercial coating in comparison with the PDMS/DVB/PDMS. The PDMS/DVB coating was more prone to irreversible matrix attachment on its surface, with consequent reduction of its extractive performance after 80 consecutive extractions. Conversely, the PDMS/DVB/PDMS coating showed enhanced inertness towards matrix fouling due to its outer smooth PDMS layer. This work represents the first step towards the development of robust SPME methods for quantification of contaminants in avocado as well as other fatty-based matrices, with minimal sample pre-treatment prior to extraction. In addition, an evaluation of matrix components attachment on the coating surface and related artifacts created by desorption of the coating at high temperatures in the GC-injector port, has been performed by GCxGC-ToF/MS.},

	abstract = {In this study, we propose for the first time the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) in combination with liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry for untargeted metabolomic profiling of biological fluids. To achieve this goal, we first systematically evaluated 42 different SPME coatings for the extraction of 36 metabolites from different chemical classes and of widely varying polarities (log P range of −7.9 to 7.4) in order to identify SPME coatings which are the most suitable for metabolomic studies and to improve the extraction of polar metabolites over the existing commercial SPME devices. Three types of SPME coatings (mixed-mode coatings, polar-enhanced polystyrene−divinylbenzene, and phenylboronic acid) performed the best for simultaneous extraction of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites at physiological conditions, thus making them suitable for untargeted metabolomic profiling applications. A rapid and simple SPME method was then developed with single-use biocompatible mixed-mode coating for the metabolomic profiling of human plasma in combination with liquid chromatography−high-resolution mass spectrometry on a benchtop Orbitrap system. This optimized SPME method was evaluated versus ultrafiltration and solvent precipitation in terms of metabolite coverage and method precision. SPME detected 1592−3320 features versus 2082−3245 features detected by solvent precipitation methods and 2093−2686 detected for ultrafiltration using the same pooled human plasma sample. Method precision of SPME ranged between 11\% and 18\% (expressed as median relative standard deviation (RSD) of n = 7 replicates) versus 8−19\% for solvent precipitation and 20−22\% for ultrafiltration. The results demonstrate that the proposed SPME methodology reduces ionization suppression, provides free concentration information for hydrophobic analytes which are not detected by ultrafiltration methods, and can improve metabolite coverage over existing methodologies.},

	abstract = {Environmental exposures often occur through short, pulsed events; therefore, the ability to accurately measure these toxicologically-relevant concentrations is important. Three different integrative passive sampler configurations were evaluated under different flow and pulsed exposure conditions for the measurement of current-use pesticides (n = 19), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (n = 10), and personal care products (n = 5) spanning a broad range of hydrophobicities (log Kow 1.5–7.6). Two modified POCIS-style samplers were investigated using macroporous nylon mesh membranes (35 μm pores) and two different sorbent materials (i.e. Oasis HLB and Dowex Optipore L-493). A recently developed design, the Sentinel Sampler (ABS Materials), utilizing Osorb media enclosed within stainless steel mesh (145 μm pores), was also investigated. Relatively high sampling rates (Rs) were achieved for all sampler configurations during the short eight-day exposure (4300–27 mL/d). Under flow conditions, median Rs were approximately 5–10 times higher for POCIS-style samplers and 27 times higher for Sentinel Samplers, as compared to static conditions. The ability of samplers to rapidly measure hydrophobic contaminants may be a trade off with increased flow dependence. Analyte accumulation was integrative under pulsed and continuous exposures for POCIS-style samplers with mean difference between treatments of 11\% and 33\%; however, accumulation into Sentinel Samplers was more variable. Collectively, results show that reducing membrane limitations allows for rapid, integrative accumulation of a broad range of analytes even under pulsed exposures. As such, these sampler designs may be suitable for monitoring environmental substances that have short aquatic half-lives.},

	abstract = {Performance reference compounds (PRCs) can be spiked into passive samplers prior to deployment. If the dissipation kinetics of PRCs from the sampler corresponds to analyte accumulation kinetics, then PRCs can be used to estimate in-situ sampling rates, which may vary depending on environmental conditions. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the effectiveness of PRC corrections on prediction accuracy of water concentrations were evaluated using nylon organic chemical integrative samplers (NOCIS). Results from PRC calibrations suggest that PRC elimination occurs faster under higher flow conditions; however, minimal differences were observed for PRC elimination between fast flow (9.3 cm/s) and slow flow (5.0 cm/s) conditions. Moreover, minimal differences were observed for PRC elimination from Dowex Optipore L-493; therefore, PRC corrections did not improve results for NOCIS configurations containing Dowex Optipore L-493. Regardless, results suggest that PRC corrections were beneficial for NOCIS configurations containing Oasis HLB; however, due to differences in flow dependencies of analyte sampling rates and PRC elimination rates across the investigated flow regimes, the use of multiple PRC corrections was necessary. As such, a “Best-Fit PRC” approach was utilized for Oasis HLB corrections using caffeine-13C3, DIA-d5, or no correction based on the relative flow dependencies of analytes and these PRCs. Although PRC corrections reduced the variability when in-situ conditions differed from laboratory calibrations (e.g. static versus moderate flow), applying PRC corrections under similar flow conditions increases variability in estimated values.},

Two types of TF-SPME passive samplers, including a retracted thin film device using a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) coating, and an open bed configuration with an octadecyl silica-based (C18)coating, were evaluated in an aqueous standard generation system. Laboratory calibration results indicated that the thin film retracted device using HLB coating is suitable to determine TWA concentrations of polar analytes in water, with an uptake that was linear up to 70 days. In open bed form, a one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique was accomplished by loading benzophenone3-d5 as calibrant on the C18 coating to quantify all nonpolar compounds. The experimental results showed that the one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique can be used for determination of classes of compounds in cases where deuterated counterparts are either not available or expensive. The developed passive samplers were deployed in wastewater-dominated reaches of the Grand River (Kitchener, ON) to verify their feasibility for determination of TWA concentrations in on-site applications. Field trials results indicated that these devices are suitable for long-term and short-term monitoring of compounds varying in polarity, such as UV blockers and biocide compounds in water, and the data were in good agreement with literature data.},

The use of performance reference compounds (PRC) spiked into the POCIS adsorbent for in situ calibration may improve the semiquantitative nature of water concentration estimates based on this type of sampler. In this work, deuterium labeled atrazine-desisopropyl (DIA-d5) was chosen as PRC because of its relatively high fugacity from Oasis HLB (the POCIS adsorbent used) and our earlier evidence of its isotropic exchange. In situ calibration of POCIS spiked with DIA-d5 was performed, and the resulting time-weighted average concentration estimates were compared with similar values from an automatic sampler equipped with Oasis HLB cartridges. Before PRC correction, water concentration estimates based on POCIS data sampling rates from a laboratory calibration exposure were systematically lower than the reference concentrations obtained with the automatic sampler. Use of the DIA-d5 PRC data to correct POCIS sampling rates narrowed differences between corresponding values derived from the two methods. Application of PRCs for in situ calibration seems promising for improving POCIS-derived concentration estimates of polar pesticides. However, careful attention must be paid to the minimization of matrix effects when the quantification is performed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Novel mass spectrometric techniques such as atmospheric pressure ionization and tandem mass spectrometry have substantially extended the spectrum of clinical chemistry methods during the past decade. In particular, liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become a standard tool in research laboratories as well as in many clinical laboratories. Although LC-MS/MS has features that suggest it has a very high analytical accuracy, potential sources of inaccuracy have recently been identified.
CONTENT: The sources of inaccuracy in LC-MS/MS methods used in the routine quantification of small molecules are described and discussed. Inaccuracy of LC-MS/MS methods can be related to the process of ionization through the insource transformation of conjugate metabolites or target analytes and may also be attributable to ionization matrix effects that have a differential impact on target analytes and internal-standard compounds. Inaccuracy can also be associated with the process of ion selection, which mainly occurs when compounds from the sample matrix share mass transitions with a target analyte. In individual assays, most potential sources of inaccuracy can be controlled by sufficient LC separation-based sample workup before MS analysis.
SUMMARY: LC-MS/MS methods should undergo rigorous and systematic validation before introduction into patient care.},

The reliability of the process relies on a correctly performed calibration experiment and a well-defined sampling rate (Rs) for target analytes. Therefore, in this review the state-of-the-art methods of passive sampler calibration for the most popular pharmaceuticals: antibiotics, hormones, β-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), along with the sampling rate variation, were presented. The advantages and difficulties in laboratory and field calibration were pointed out, according to the needs of control of the exact conditions. Sampling rate calculating equations and all the factors affecting the Rs value – temperature, flow, pH, salinity of the donor phase and biofouling – were discussed. Moreover, various calibration parameters gathered from the literature published in the last 16 years, including the device types, were tabled and compared. What is evident is that the sampling rate values for pharmaceuticals are impacted by several factors, whose influence is still unclear and unpredictable, while there is a big gap in experimental data. It appears that the calibration procedure needs to be improved, for example, there is a significant deficiency of PRCs (Performance Reference Compounds) for pharmaceuticals. One of the suggestions is to introduce correction factors for Rs values estimated in laboratory conditions.},

Two types of TF-SPME passive samplers, including a retracted thin film device using a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) coating, and an open bed configuration with an octadecyl silica-based (C18)coating, were evaluated in an aqueous standard generation system. Laboratory calibration results indicated that the thin film retracted device using HLB coating is suitable to determine TWA concentrations of polar analytes in water, with an uptake that was linear up to 70 days. In open bed form, a one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique was accomplished by loading benzophenone3-d5 as calibrant on the C18 coating to quantify all nonpolar compounds. The experimental results showed that the one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique can be used for determination of classes of compounds in cases where deuterated counterparts are either not available or expensive. The developed passive samplers were deployed in wastewater-dominated reaches of the Grand River (Kitchener, ON) to verify their feasibility for determination of TWA concentrations in on-site applications. Field trials results indicated that these devices are suitable for long-term and short-term monitoring of compounds varying in polarity, such as UV blockers and biocide compounds in water, and the data were in good agreement with literature data.},

The kinetics of desorption were measured by means of a technique in which Tenax TA beads are used as “sink” for desorbed solute. A first-order kinetic model with three sediment compartments described the desorption of the test compounds from the sediments. Apart from a rapidly desorbing fraction, two sediment fractions were distinguished, one slowly desorbing with a rate constant of (1−4) × 10-3 h-1 and a very slowly desorbing one with rate constants ap proximately 10−50 times smaller. From temperature dependence studies, the activation enthalpies for slow desorption appeared to be 60−70 kJ mol-1 for both the lab-contaminated and the field-contaminated sediments; the values were approximately constant for all compounds studied. From adsorption studies at two temperatures, enthalpies of sorption to the slow sediment compartment appeared to be slightly negative. Because slow desorption is much faster at elevated temperatures, the measurement of high-temperature desorption kinetics can provide information on long-term desorption kinetics and, probably, on the feasibility of bioremediation of aged contaminants.},

Desorption kinetics for PAHs with a log octanol−water partition coefficient greater than 6 were well-described by a one-domain diffusion model that assumes that PAHs are initially uniformly distributed throughout spherical sediment aggregates. PAH hydrophobicity and sediment specific surface area were the parameters most strongly correlated with the magnitude of the observed diffusivity for the one-domain model. For less hydrophobic PAHs, a two-domain desorption model was used also, and the results suggest that a substantial fraction of these field-aged PAHs desorb via a relatively fast macro-mesopore diffusion mechanism. The model-predicted fraction of PAHs in the fast-diffusion regime by compound and sediment was highly correlated with the measured percent PAH desorption in 24 h. The fast-domain diffusivity was 100 times greater than the slow-domain diffusivity, was correlated with both PAH properties and sediment physical and chemical properties, and could be estimated by readily obtainable physical and chemical parameters. In contrast, the slow-domain diffusivity was not significantly correlated with PAH properties. Our results suggest that macro-mesopore diffusion may control mass transport of less-hydrophobic PAHs in estuarine sediments.},

The biokinetic data in the systems with and without intra-aggregate mass transport limitations were compared with abiotic PAH desorption kinetics. The results indicate that intra-aggregate mass transport limitations, and not the intrinsic bacterial PAH utilization capacity, were most important in controlling the rate of biodegradation of sediment-sorbed PAHs. Achievable extent of biodegradation could be predicted by the independently measured fraction of desorbable PAHs in the fast-diffusion regime of a two-domain intra-aggregate mass transport model. A closed-form mathematical model was developed to describe sediment-pore water partitioning and rapid aqueous-phase diffusion of PAHs through the macropore and mesopore network of sediment aggregates, followed by first-order biodegradation of desorbed PAHs in the bulk aqueous domain. The model effectively predicted independent biodegradation kinetics of PAHs field-aged in two estuarine sediments. Despite low aqueous solubility of PAHs, macropore and mesopore diffusion may be an important mechanism controlling intra-aggregate mass transport and bioavailability of the most readily and extensively desorbed PAHs in sediments.},

Room-temperature PAH desorption kinetic studies on separated sediment fractions revealed slow desorption rates for the coal-derived particles and fast desorption rates for the clay/silt particles. The effect of temperature on PAH release was measured by thermal program desorption mass spectrometry to investigate the desorption activation energies for PAHs on the different sediment particles. Three activated diffusion-based models and an activated first-order rate model were used to describe the thermal desorption of PAHs for four molecular weight classes. PAH binding with the coal-derived particles was associated with high activation energies, typically in the range of 115−139 kJ/mol. PAHs bound to the clay/silt material had much lower activation energy, i.e., in the range of 37−41 kJ/mol for molecular weight 202. Among the desorption models tested, a spherical diffusion model with PAHs located like a rind on the outer 1−3 μm region best described the PAH thermal desorption response for coal-derived particles. This internal PAH distribution pattern on coal-derived particles is based on prior direct measurement of PAH locations at the subparticle scale. These studies reveal that heterogeneous particle types in sediment exhibit much different amounts and binding of PAHs. PAHs associated with coal-derived particles aged over several decades in the field appear to be far from reaching an equilibrium sorption state due to the extremely slow diffusivities through the polymer-like coal matrix. These results provide an improved mechanistic perspective for the understanding of PAH mobility and bioavailability in sediments.},

	abstract = {Long-term adsorption of phenanthrene to soils was characterized in a silt-loam (LHS), a sandy soil (SBS), and a podzolized soil (CNS) by use of the Polanyi−Manes model, a Langmuir-type model, and a black carbon−water distribution coefficient (KBC) at a relative aqueous concentration (Ce/Sw) of 0.002−0.32. Aqueous desorption kinetic tests and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were also used to evaluate phenanthrene diffusivities and desorption activation energies. Adsorption contribution in soils was 48−70\% after 30 days and 64−95\% after 270 days. Significant increases in adsorption capacity with aging suggest that accessibility of phenanthrene to fractions of SBS soil matrix was controlled by sorptive diffusion at narrow meso- and micropore constrictions. Similar trends were not significant for LHS silt-loam or CNS podzol. Analysis of TPD profiles reveal desorption activation energies of 35−53 kJ/mol and diffusivities of 1.6 × 10-7-9.7 × 10-8 cm2/s. TPD tests also indicate that the fraction of phenanthrene mass not diffusing from soils was located within micropores and narrow width mesopores with a corresponding volume of 1.83 × 10-5-6.37 × 10-5 cm3/g. These values were consistent with the modeled adsorption contributions, thus demonstrating the need for such complimentary analytical approach in the risk assessment of organic contaminants.},

Temperature-stepped desorption (TSD) rates were measured for these solids in columns prepared and equilibrated at 30 °C, but heated instantaneously to 60 °C after ∼1000 min of slow desorption. Fast and slow elution rates are observed for all solids. Modeling results for the fast eluting fraction of TCE show that fast desorption is controlled by diffusion through aqueous filled mesopores. Rates predicted from diffusion and surface-barrier models are compared to slow isothermal and TSD rates. Diffusion model fits are superior to surface-barrier model fits in all cases. Slow diffusion coef ficients and a high activation energy calculated from silica gel data (∼34 kJ/mol) indicate that slow desorption is controlled by activated diffusion in micropores. Initial amounts of slow desorbing TCE do not affect these rates and are found to obey Polanyi's equation. The mass adsorbed in non-Freundlich isotherm regions, where micropores are hypothesized to control adsorption, is 10 times greater than the mass adsorbed at the onset of slow desorption, sug gesting that these pores are undulating in nature. TSD column results are consistent with a mechanism where slow diffusion rates are controlled by sorptive forces at hydrophobic micropore constrictions.},

	abstract = {After more than 25 years, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has gained widespread acceptance as a well-automatable and flexible microextraction technique, while its instrumental basis remained mostly unchanged. The novel PAL (Prep And Load solution) SPME Arrow combines the advantages of SPME with the benefits of extraction techniques providing larger sorption phase volumes such as stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE). It thereby avoids the inherent drawbacks of both techniques such as limitations in method automation in the case of SBSE, as well as the small sorption phase volumes and the lacking fiber robustness of classical SPME fibers. This new design is based on a robust stainless steel backbone, carrying, the screw connection to the PAL sampler, the enlarged sorption phase, and an arrow-shaped tip for conservative penetration of septa (hence the name). An outer capillary encloses this phase apart from enrichment and desorption processes and rests against the tip during transfer and penetrations, resulting in a homogeneously closed device. Here, we present an evaluation and a comparison of the novel PAL SPME Arrow with classical SPME fibers, extracting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as model analytes, from the freely dissolved fraction in lab water and groundwater via direct immersion using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as common sorption phase material. Limits of detection, repeatabilities, and extraction yields were determined for the PAL SPME Arrow and compared to data of classical SPME fibers and SBSE bars. Results indicate a significant benefit in extraction efficiency due to the larger sorption phase volume. It is accompanied by faultless mechanical robustness and thus better reliability, especially in case of prolonged, unattended, and automated operation. As an exemplary application, the water-soluble fraction of PAHs and derivatives in a roofing felt sample was quantified.Open image in new windowGraphical AbstractPicture of a PAL SPME Arrow during extraction of a stirred water sample},

Literature Kfw data were thoroughly evaluated, and additional Kfw values for 69 compounds were measured in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at 37 °C. These Kfw data, spanning over 6 orders of magnitude, were used to construct polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) models. The PP-LFER models fit well to the data with a standard deviation of 0.15−0.23 log units. Additional experiments indicated that the differences in temperature (25 vs 37 °C), electrolyte concentrations (pure water vs PBS), and conditioning methods (heat vs methanol) had only minor influences ({\textless}0.3 log units) on Kfw.

	abstract = {Time weighted average (TWA) passive sampling with thin film solid phase microextraction (TF-SPME) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for collection, identification, and quantification of benzophenone-1, benzophenone-2, benzophenone-3, benzophenone-4, 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, octocrylene, octylmethoxycinnamate, butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane, triclocarban and triclosan in the aquatic environment. Two types of TF-SPME passive samplers, including a retracted thin film device using a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) coating, and an open bed configuration with an octadecyl silica-based (C18)coating, were evaluated in an aqueous standard generation system. Laboratory calibration results indicated that the thin film retracted device using HLB coating is suitable to determine TWA concentrations of polar analytes in water, with an uptake that was linear up to 70 days. In open bed form, a one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique was accomplished by loading benzophenone3-d5 as calibrant on the C18 coating to quantify all nonpolar compounds. The experimental results showed that the one-calibrant kinetic calibration technique can be used for determination of classes of compounds in cases where deuterated counterparts are either not available or expensive. The developed passive samplers were deployed in wastewater-dominated reaches of the Grand River (Kitchener, ON) to verify their feasibility for determination of TWA concentrations in on-site applications. Field trials results indicated that these devices are suitable for long-term and short-term monitoring of compounds varying in polarity, such as UV blockers and biocide compounds in water, and the data were in good agreement with literature data.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of plastics, an obvious consequence of their usefulness and low price, has turned them into a problem of environmental and safety concern. The new plastic economy, an initiative recently launched by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation, with analytical support from McKinsey \&amp; Company, promotes a change in the use of plastic worldwide around three main pillars: redesign, reusing and recycling. Recycled plastics, with the aim of extending their life spam, can be used to synthesize materials for analytical purposes. In this article polystyrene (PS) trays, previously used for food packaging, are proposed as polymeric source for the synthesis of magnetic nanocomposites. The synthesis plays with the solubility of PS in different solvents in such a way that PS is gelated in the presence of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles which are finally embedded in the polymeric network. The extraction capability of the magnetic PS nanocomposite was evaluated using the determination of four parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben) in water using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as model analytical problem. Under the optimum conditions, limits of detection and quantification were in the range of 0.05–0.15 and 0.15–0.5 ng/mL, respectively. The precisions, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), varied between 4.4\% and 8.5\% and the relative recoveries for analysis of the water samples were in the interval 81.2–104.5\%.},

Existing in vivo SPME-kinetic calibration (SPME-KC) approaches are unwieldy due to the necessity of predetermining a distribution coefficient for the analyte of interest in the tissue and the preloading of a calibrating compound to the fiber. In this study, a rapid and convenient SPME alternative calibration method for in vivo analysis, termed SPME-sampling rate (SPME-SR) calibration, was developed and validated under both laboratory and field conditions to eliminate such presampling requirements. Briefly, the SPME probe is inserted into tissue, in this study fish dorsal-epaxial muscle, for 20 min allowing the concentrations of target analytes in the fish muscle to be determined by the extracted amount of analyte and the predetermined sampling rates. Atrazine, carbamazepine, and fluoxetine were detected nonlethally in the low ppb levels within fish muscle, with both laboratory and field-derived results obtained by in vivo SPME-KC comparable (within a factor of 1.27) to those obtained by lethal sampling followed by tissue liquid extraction. The technique described in this study represents an important advance which broadens the application of SPME in vivo sampling technology.},

However, most of these studies only focused on the measurement of specific toxicants and did not examine the impact of chemical mixtures. In this study, we examined whether the tissue exposome captured in vivo with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) without lethal sampling and analyzed by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry can detect differences between Catostomus commersonii exhibiting a significant induction of CYP1A1, through case/control comparisons, controlling for false discovery rates. We observed the presence of environmental toxicants in induced case fish known as potential inducers of CYP1A1. We also found significant changes in the levels of anti-oxidants, short-lived oxysterols and other lipids associated with CYP1A1 induction, possibly due to oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and free fatty acids mobilization to maintain homeostatic state. In vivo SPME opens the way to perform repeated sampling on the same animal over the time and explore the individual internal exposome trajectory for better characterization of the links between toxicant load and health effects, at the individual scale.},

The characterizations of polymers were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET). The properties involving adsorption and selective experiments were evaluated, and these results revealed that MIP fibers presented high adsorption capacity and selectivity to luteolin. Furthermore, the developed MIP-SPME coupled with the LC-QTOF-MS/MS method was adopted to capture and identify luteolin and its metabolites in rat livers in vivo, and eventually, apigenin, chrysoeriol, and diosmetin were rapidly identified as metabolites.},

The analytical performance of the developed method was evaluated in homogenized tilapia dorsal muscle, and the results demonstrated that the present method possessed low detection limits 1.7–9.4 ng g−1), wide linear ranges (10 or 30–5000 ng g−1), and satisfactory reproducibility (relative standard deviations no more than 8.1\% and 10.8\% for inter-fiber and intra-fiber assays, respectively). Standard curves were established in homogenized tilapia dorsal muscle for calibrating in vivo SPME in living tilapias. And the concentrations determined by in vivo SPME were close to those determined by the liquid extraction. By using the present method, one anesthetic residue was detected above the detection limit in tilapias from the local markets. Comparing to traditional methods, the present one exhibited superior time-efficiency and cost performance, as the extraction time was only ten minutes, which was short to successfully avoid the possible loss of analytes caused by elimination and sample storage. In addition, owing to the time-efficiency of the present method, the elimination of the anesthetics in tilapias was traced successfully in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the direct coupling of solid phase microextraction (SPME) and mass spectrometry (MS) has shown its great potential to improve limits of quantitation, accelerate analysis throughput, and diminish potential matrix effects when compared to direct injection to MS. In this study, we introduce the open port probe (OPP) as a robust interface to couple biocompatible SPME (Bio-SPME) fibers to MS systems for direct electrospray ionization. The presented design consisted of minimal alterations to the front-end of the instrument and provided better sensitivity, simplicity, speed, wider compound coverage, and high-throughput in comparison to the LC–MS based approach. Quantitative determination of clenbuterol, fentanyl, and buprenorphine was successfully achieved in human urine. Despite the use of short extraction/desorption times (5 min/5 s), limits of quantitation below the minimum required performance levels (MRPL) set by the world antidoping agency (WADA) were obtained with good accuracy (≥90\%) and linearity (R2 {\textgreater} 0.99) over the range evaluated for all analytes using sample volumes of 300 μL. In-line technologies such as multiple reaction monitoring with multistage fragmentation (MRM3) and differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) were used to enhance the selectivity of the method without compromising analysis speed. On the basis of calculations, once coupled to high throughput, this method can potentially yield preparation times as low as 15 s per sample based on the 96-well plate format. Our results demonstrated that Bio-SPME-OPP-MS efficiently integrates sampling/sample cleanup and atmospheric pressure ionization, making it an advantageous configuration for several bioanalytical applications, including doping in sports, in vivo tissue sampling, and therapeutic drug monitoring.},

This study first reports the dynamic changes of volatiles and phenols that occur during skin fermentation in white winemaking. Volatiles were analysed by solid-phase extraction (SPE), solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography (GC), and phenols by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), both with mass spectrometric detection. Monoterpenols increased during the first 3 days of skin fermentation, after which certain glycosides decreased, but were higher than in control. The presence of skins reduced ho-trienol, β-damascenone, acids and esters. After a 1–3 days lag phase, skin fermentation caused a constant increase of most phenols. It was estimated that skin fermentation up to 1–3 days might be beneficial for monoterpenol varietal aroma, which should be re-evaluated through further studies. Longer durations promoted phenol extraction more strongly, which is possibly suitable for obtaining more distinct wines or blending components. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current work presents the optimization of a protocol enabling direct extraction of avocado samples by a new Solid Phase Microextraction matrix compatible coating. In order to further extend the coating life time, pre-desorption and post-desorption washing steps were optimized for solvent type, time, and degree of agitation employed. Using optimized conditions, lifetime profiles of the coating related to extraction of a group of analytes bearing different physical-chemical properties were obtained. Over 80 successive extractions were carried out to establish coating efficiency using PDMS/DVB 65 µm commercial coating in comparison with the PDMS/DVB/PDMS. The PDMS/DVB coating was more prone to irreversible matrix attachment on its surface, with consequent reduction of its extractive performance after 80 consecutive extractions. Conversely, the PDMS/DVB/PDMS coating showed enhanced inertness towards matrix fouling due to its outer smooth PDMS layer. This work represents the first step towards the development of robust SPME methods for quantification of contaminants in avocado as well as other fatty-based matrices, with minimal sample pre-treatment prior to extraction. In addition, an evaluation of matrix components attachment on the coating surface and related artifacts created by desorption of the coating at high temperatures in the GC-injector port, has been performed by GCxGC-ToF/MS.},

This device performs clean up, extraction, and pre-concentration in a single step. It suits best for extraction of complex samples as sorbent is effectively protected inside the membrane and extraneous matter cannot adsorb over it. This review summarizes most important aspects of μ-SPE including basic principles, extraction procedure, different formats, sorbents employed and affecting parameters. The article also provides a brief account on modified μ-SPE procedures where μ-SPE was either combined with other techniques or some major changes were introduced in original procedure. Finally, the applications of μ-SPE in environmental, food and biological analysis are described. At the end, advantages and pitfalls of μ-SPE are critically appraised.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a new vacuum headspace solid-phase microextraction (Vac-HSSPME) method combined to gas chromatography-flame ionization detection for the determination of free fatty acids (FFAs) and phenols. All target analytes of the multicomponent solution were volatiles but their low Henry's Law constants rendered them amenable to Vac-HSSPME. The ability of a new and easy to construct Vac-HSSPME sampler to maintain low-pressure conditions for extended sampling times was concurrently demonstrated. Vac-HSSPME and regular HSSPME methods were independently optimized and the results were compared at all times. The performances of four commercial SPME fibers and two polymeric ionic liquid (PIL)-based SPME fibers were evaluated and the best overall results were obtained with the adsorbent-type CAR/PDMS fiber. For the concentrations used here, competitive displacement became more intense for the smaller and more volatile analytes of the multi-component solution when lowering the sampling pressure. The extraction time profiles showed that Vac-HSSPME had a dramatic positive effect on extraction kinetics. The local maxima of adsorbed analytes recorded with Vac-HSSPME occurred faster, but were always lower than that with regular HSSPME due to the faster analyte-loading from the multicomponent solution. Increasing the sampling temperature during Vac-HSSPME reduced the extraction efficiency of smaller analytes due to the enhancement in water molecule collisions with the fiber. This effect was not recorded for the larger phenolic compounds. Based on the optimum values selected, Vac-HSSPME required a shorter extraction time and milder sampling conditions than regular HSSPME: 20 min and 35 °C for Vac-HSSPME versus 40 min and 45 °C for regular HSSPME. The performance of the optimized Vac-HSSPME and regular HSSPME procedures were assessed and Vac-HSSPME method proved to be more sensitive, with lower limits of detection (from 0.14 to 13 μg L−1), and better intra-day precision (relative standard deviations values \&lt; 10\% at the lowest spiked level) than regular HSSPME for almost all target analytes. The proposed Vac-HSSPME method was successfully applied to quantify FFAs and phenols in milk and milk derivatives samples.},

	abstract = {The main quest for the implementation of direct SPME to complex matrices has been the development of matrix compatible coatings that provide sufficient sensitivity towards the target analytes. In this context, we present here a thorough evaluation of PDMS-overcoated fibers suitable for simultaneous extraction of different polarities analytes, while maintaining adequate matrix compatibility. For this, eleven analytes were selected, from various application classes (pesticides, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and with a wide range of log P values (ranging from 1.43 to 6). The model matrix chosen was commercial Concord grape juice, which is rich in pigments such as anthocyanins, and contains approximately 20\% of sugar (w/w). Two types of PDMS, as well as other intrinsic factors associated with the PDMS-overcoated fiber fabrication are studied. The evaluation showed that the PDMS-overcoated fibers considerably slowed down the coating fouling process during direct immersion in complex matrices of high sugar content. Longevity differences could be seen between the two types of PDMS tested, with a proprietary Sylgard® giving superior performance because of lesser amount of reactive groups and enhanced hydrophobicity. Conversely, the thickness of the outer layer did not seem to have a significant effect on the fiber lifetime. We also demonstrate that the uniformity of the overcoated PDMS layer is paramount to the achievement of reliable data and extended fiber lifetime. Employing the optimum overcoated fiber, limits of detection (LOD) in the range of 0.2–1.3 ng/g could be achieved. Additional improvement is attainable by introducing washing of the coatings after desorption, so that any carbon build-up (fouling) left on the coating surface after thermal desorption can be removed.},

Novel magnetic octadecylsilane (ODS)-polyacrylonitrile (PAN) thin-films were prepared by spraying, and used for the microextraction of quetiapine and clozapine in plasma and urine samples, followed by the detection of HPLC-UV. The influencing factors on the extraction efficiency of magnetic ODS-PAN TFME, including pH, extraction time, desorption solvent, desorption time, and ion strength were investigated systematically. Under the optimal conditions, both analytes showed good linearity over ranges of 0.070–9.000 μg mL−1 and 0.012–9.000 μg mL−1 in plasma and urine samples, respectively, with correlation coefficients (R2) above 0.9990. Limits of detection (LODs) for quetiapine in plasma and urine samples were 0.013 and 0.003 μg mL−1, respectively. LODs for clozapine in plasma and urine samples were 0.015 and 0.003 μg mL−1, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for quetiapine and clozapine were less than 9.23\%. After the validation, the protocol was successfully applied for the determination of quetiapine and clozapine in patients’ plasma and urine samples with satisfactory recoveries between 99–110\%. The proposed magnetic ODS-PAN TFME was very simple, fast and easy to handle. It showed high potential as a powerful pretreatment technology for routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in plasma and urine samples.},

Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry methods were optimized and applied for separation and detection of compounds. Evaluation of five different stationary phases showed that polystyrene-divinylbenzene-polyacrylonitrile (PS-DVB-PAN) is the optimum extraction phase for the extraction of phenolic compounds under study. The thin-film PS-DVB-PAN SPME coating provided almost exhaustive extraction recovery for all phenolics compounds under study, except for naringenin with 80\% recovery. Extraction efficiency, inter- and intra-day reproducibility, sensitivity, linearity, limit of detection and quantitation, and matrix effect were evaluated. Intra-day and inter-day reproducibility were in the respective range of 4–8 and 7–13\% relative standard deviation (RSD) for all eight phenolic compounds. Limits of detection and quantitation of the proposed SPME-LC–MS/MS system for the analysis of analytes under study were found in the range of 0.2–3 and 0.5–10 ng/mL, respectively. Standard addition calibration was applied for the quantitative determination of unknown phenolic compounds from wine, berry, and grape samples. The assessment of matrix effect showed significant reduction of ion suppression/enhancement using SPME method in comparison with that of solvent extraction technique.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of the inclusion of a water-insoluble drug (diazepam, DZ) into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), which offer combined advantages of rapid onset and prolonged release of the drug. This work also describes a new approach to prepare suppositories containing DZ-loaded SLN dispersions, as potential drug carrier for the rectal route. Modified high-shear homogenization and ultrasound techniques were employed to prepare SLNs. The effect of incorporation of different concentrations of Compritol® ATO 888 or Imwitor® 900K and Poloxamer 188 or Tween 80 was investigated. Results showed that varying the type or concentration of lipid matrix or surfactant had a noticeable influence on the entrapment efficiencies, particle size, and release profiles of prepared SLNs. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the majority of SLNs possessed less ordered arrangements of crystals than the corresponding bulk lipids, which was favorable for increasing the drug loading capacity. Transmission electron microscopy and laser diffractometry studies revealed that the prepared nanoparticles were round and homogeneous and 60\% of the formulations were less than 500 nm. Additionally, SLN formulations showed significant (P {\textless} 0.05) prolonged release than DZ solution. The subsequent step encompassed the preparation and evaluation of SLN-based suppositories utilizing SLN formulations that illustrated optimal release profiles. The in vitro release of DZ from the suppositories prepared using DZ-loaded SLN dispersions (equivalent to 2 mg DZ) was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) extended compared to suppositories containing 2 mg DZ free drug.},

	abstract = {Whole blood viscosity is affected by a number of factors, among which plasma proteins are a major component. They exert their effects either directly or through their influence on red cell aggregation. Changes in fibrinogen and in immunoglobulins, under both physiologic and pathologic conditions can increase whole blood viscosity. Blood flow through the microvasculature is impaired when viscosity increases, leading to tissue ischemia and a syndrome complex usually referred to as the hyperviscosity syndrome. Abnormalities of fibrinogen greatly increase its ability to cause red cell aggregation, and is a contributory pathogenic factor in ischemic heart disease and stroke. Immunoglobulins may affect blood viscosity directly, or by increasing the red cell aggregation. Changes are seen in many clinical disorders, ranging from inflammatory diseases to plasma cell dyscrasias. The clinical manifestations may be mild and often unnoticed, or they may be life threatening requiring emergency plasmapheresis. Proper management requires a clear understanding of the underlying pathology. When the symptom complex indicates a high probability of the hyperviscosity syndrome, it should lead to early diagnosis and treatment. Therapeutic approaches should include both removing the abnormal plasma protein and treating the primary cause.},

	abstract = {A unifying approach is presented for developing mathematical models of microdialysis that are applicable to both in vitro and in vivo situations. Previous models for cylindrical probes have been limited by accommodating analyte diffusion through the surrounding medium in the radial direction only, i.e., perpendicular to the probe axis, or by incomplete incorporation of diffusion in the axial direction. Both radial and axial diffusion are included in the present work by employing two-dimensional finite element analysis. As in previous models, the nondimensional clearance modulus (Θ) represents the degree to which analyte clearance from the external medium influences diffusion through the medium for systems exhibiting analyte concentration linearity. Incorporating axial diffusion introduces a second dimensionless group, which is the length-to-radius aspect ratio of the membrane. These two parameter groups uniquely determine the external medium permeability, which is time dependent under transient conditions. At steady-state, the dependence of this permeability on the two groups can be approximated by an algebraic formula for much of the parameter ranges. Explicit steady-state expressions derived for the membrane and fluid permeabilities provide good approximations under transient conditions (quasi-steady-state assumption). The predictive ability of the unifying approach is illustrated for microdialysis of sucrose in vivo (brain) and inert media in vitro, under both well-stirred and quiescent conditions.},

However, from Van der Waals radius of the results obtained, these solutes are monomer state.In spite of a large size, the diffusion coefficient of Uridine-5′-monophosphoric acid indicates a high value because of the potential gradient occurs in diffusion.

The method takes advantage of the increased peak dispersion in a two-dimensional spectrum and allows the measurement of diffusion coefficients of individual molecules in complex biofluid samples in a condition close to their natural state. The NMR spectra can be edited on the basis of diffusion coefficient, and hence, approximate molecular size and this provides a qualitative means of simplifying the spectra for assignment purposes. The use of two-dimensional DETOCSY NMR spectra increases the probability that the individual cross-peaks arise from single components and hence allows single-exponential fitting of the magnetic field gradient dependence of cross-peak volumes. Interpretation of the derived diffusion coefficients improves the NMR resonance assignment process in complex biofluid mixtures by giving additional information on the molecular size. The DETOCSY approach also provides information on small molecule−macromolecule interactions such as the binding of drugs or endogenous species to serum proteins such as albumin.},

Literature Kfw data were thoroughly evaluated, and additional Kfw values for 69 compounds were measured in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at 37 °C.

The PP-LFER models fit well to the data with a standard deviation of 0.15−0.23 log units. Additional experiments indicated that the differences in temperature (25 vs 37 °C), electrolyte concentrations (pure water vs PBS), and conditioning methods (heat vs methanol) had only minor influences ({\textless}0.3 log units) on Kfw. Using the established PP-LFERs, the SPME extraction efficiency of PA coating toward compounds of differing polarity was evaluated in comparison to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) coating. PA exhibited higher extraction capacities for H-bond donor compounds (e.g., phenols, anilines, amides, and many drugs and pesticides) with the estimated Kfw values being 1−4 log units higher than those of PDMS.

Unlike other polymeric materials commonly used as EPS, namely poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and low-density polyethylene (PE), POM is a polar polymer, containing repeating H-bond accepting ether units. Thus, POM is expected to be a more sensitive EPS than PDMS and PE for polar, H-bond donating compounds, such as many hormones, pharmaceuticals, and biocides. To better characterize the sorption capacity of POM for diverse polar and apolar compounds, equilibrium POM–water partition coefficients, KPOM/w, were measured for 56 compounds, including several classes of polar compounds and organochlorine pesticides. Using this data set and literature data, various POM-partitioning models were calibrated and validated for their ability to predict KPOM/w. The best performing models tested were an Abraham descriptor based polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) (SD = 0.24 log units) and COSMOthermX (SD = 0.37 log units). The performance of SPARC (SD = 0.61 log units) and log–log correlations with Kow (SD = 0.49 log units) were lower. A comparison with PDMS and PE confirmed expectations that POM exhibits a higher sensitivity for H-bond donating polar compounds than PDMS and PE do for these compounds. These findings expand the domain of chemicals for which POM can be used as an EPS sampler, and demonstrate that POM is as suitable a passive sampler for many polar organic compounds as it is for hydrophobic organic compounds.},

Here, we demonstrate that comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) retention times can be used to predict 26 relevant properties for nonpolar chemicals, specifically: partition coefficients for diverse biotic media and passive sampler phases; aquatic baseline toxicity; and relevant diffusion coefficients. The considered biotic and passive sampler phases include membrane and storage lipids, serum and muscle proteins, carbohydrates, algae, mussels, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene, polyoxymethylene, polyacrylate, polyurethane, and semipermeable membrane devices. GC × GC-based chemical property predictions are validated with a compilation of 1038 experimental property data collected from the literature. As an example application, we overlay a map of baseline toxicity to fathead minnows onto the separated analyte signal of a polychlorinated alkanes (chlorinated paraffins) technical mixture that contains 7820 congeners. In a second application, GC × GC-estimated properties are used to parametrize multiphase partitioning models for mammalian tissues and organs. In a third example, we estimate chemical depuration kinetics for mussels. Finally, we illustrate an approach to screen the GC × GC chromatogram for nonpolar chemicals of potentially high concern, defined based on their GC × GC-estimated biopartitioning properties, diffusion properties, and baseline toxicity.},

All chemical geometries were optimized by semi-empirical PM6 algorithm. Several quantum chemical parameters that reflect various intermolecular interactions as well as hydrophobicity were selected to develop QSAR model. The result indicates the regression model derived from logKow, the most positive net atomic charges on an atom, Connolly solvent excluded volume, polarizability, and Abraham acidity could explain the partitioning mechanism of organic chemicals between BSA and water. The simulated external validation and cross validation verifies the developed model has good statistical robustness and predictive ability, thus can be used to estimate the logKBSA/W values for chemicals in application domain, accordingly to provide basic data for the toxicity assessment of the chemicals.},

	abstract = {High-throughput in vitro bioassays are becoming increasingly important in the risk characterization of anthropogenic chemicals. Large databases gather nominal effect concentrations (Cnom) for diverse modes of action. However, the biologically effective concentration can substantially deviate due to differences in chemical partitioning. In this study, we modeled freely dissolved (Cfree), cellular (Ccell), and membrane concentrations (Cmem) in the Tox21 GeneBLAzer bioassays for a set of neutral and ionogenic organic chemicals covering a large physicochemical space. Cells and medium constituents were experimentally characterized for their lipid and protein content and partition constants were collected from the literature or predicted by mechanistic models. The chemicals exhibited multifaceted partitioning to proteins and lipids with distribution ratios spanning over eight orders of magnitude. Modeled Cfree deviated over five orders of magnitude from Cnom, and can be compared to in vivo effect data, environmental concentrations and the unbound fraction in plasma, which is needed for the in vitro to in vivo extrapolation. Ccell was relatively constant for chemicals with membrane lipid-water distribution ratios of 1000 or higher and proportional to Cnom. Representing a sum parameter for exposure that integrates the entire dose from intracellular partitioning, Ccell is particularly suitable for the effect characterization of chemicals with multiple target sites and the calculation of their relative effect potencies. Effective membrane concentrations indicated that the specific effects of very hydrophobic chemicals in multiple bioassays are occurring at concentrations close to cytotoxicity. The equilibrium partitioning model including all relevant system parameters and a generic set-up is attached as an excel workbook to this paper and can readily be applied by everyone to diverse in vitro bioassays.},

Among other proteins, structural proteins including muscle proteins could be an important sorption phase for IOCs, because of their high quantity in the human and other animals’ body and their polar nature. Binding data for IOCs to structural proteins are, however, severely limited. Therefore, in this study muscle protein–water partition coefficients (KMP/w) of 51 systematically selected organic anions and cations were determined experimentally. A comparison of the measured KMP/w with bovine serum albumin (BSA)–water partition coefficients showed that anionic chemicals sorb more strongly to BSA than to muscle protein (by up to 3.5 orders of magnitude), while cations sorb similarly to both proteins. Sorption isotherms of selected IOCs to muscle protein are linear (i.e., KMP/w is concentration independent), and KMP/w is only marginally influenced by pH value and salt concentration. Using the obtained data set of KMP/w a polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) model was established. The derived equation fits the data well (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.29). Finally, it was demonstrated that the in vitro measured KMP/w values of this study have the potential to be used to evaluate tissue-plasma partitioning of IOCs in vivo.},

study reports the distribution coefficient between phospholipid bilayer
membranes and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) medium (DMW,PBS) for 19 cationic surfactants. The method used a
sorbent dilution series with solid supported lipid membranes (SSLMs).
The existing SSLM protocol, applying a 96 well plate setup, was adapted
to use 1.5 mL glass autosampler vials instead, which facilitated sampling
and circumvented several confounding loss processes for some of the
cationic surfactants. About 1\% of the phospholipids were found to
be detached from the SSLM beads, resulting in nonlinear sorption isotherms
for compounds with log DMW values above
4. Renewal of the medium resulted in linear sorption isotherms. DMW values determined at pH 5.4 demonstrated
that cationic surfactant species account for the observed DMW,PBS. Log DMW,PBS values above 5.5 are only experimentally feasible with lower LC-MS/MS
detection limits and/or concentrated extracts of the aqueous samples.
Based on the number of carbon atoms, dialkylamines showed a considerably
lower sorption affinity than linear alkylamine analogues. These SSLM
results closely overlapped with measurements on a chromatographic
tool based on immobilized artificial membranes (IAM-HPLC) and with
quantum-chemistry based calculations with COSMOmic. The SSLM data
suggest that IAM-HPLC underestimates the DMW of ionized primary and secondary alkylamines by 0.8 and 0.5 log
units, respectively.},

In contrast to neutral organic chemicals, the partitioning behavior of ionogenic organic chemicals (IOCs) is still a black box for environmental scientists. Partitioning to serum albumin, the major protein in blood plasma, strongly influences the freely dissolved concentration of many chemicals (including IOCs), which affects their transport and distribution in the body. Because consistent data sets for partitioning of IOCs are rarely available, bovine serum albumin-water partition coefficients (KBSA/w) were measured in this study for 45 anionic and 4 cationic organic chemicals, including various substituted benzoic and naphthoic acids, sulfonates and several pesticides and pharmaceuticals. The results of this study suggest that binding to BSA is substantially influenced by the three-dimensional structure of the chemicals and the position of substitutions on the sorbing molecules. For example, we found a difference of {\textgreater}1.5 log units between isomeric chemicals such as 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid, and 1-naphthoic acid and 2-naphthoic acid. Conventional modeling approaches (e.g., based on octanol–water partition coefficients) poorly predict log KBSA/w of organic ions (R2 ≤ 0.5), partially because they do not capture the observed steric effects. Hence, alternative modeling strategies will be required for accurate prediction of serum albumin-water partition coefficients of organic ions.},

Sorption was investigated in batch-equilibrium experiments by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) resulting in partitioning coefficients of solid–water (Kd), total organic carbon–water (KTOC), and dissolved organic carbon–water (KDOC). Results prove a high affinity of HOCs for FF and FR supporting a significant impact on BCF studies and differing from sorption to Aldrich-humic acid (AHA) utilized as reference sorbent. Sorption is influenced by interactions between HOCs and OM characteristics. For FF, KDOC values were higher than KTOC values.

Good agreement with the model predictions was found for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and m-xylene at four different representative fixed concentration ratios after 1 h of exposure, but lower agreement with mixture prediction was obtained after 24 h of exposure.

Understanding the partitioning of PBDEs to biological phases is crucial for elucidating their bioaccumulation behavior. In this study, partitioning coefficients of PBDEs from water to phospholipid liposomes (Klipw) and to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (KBSAw) were measured using a polymer depletion method. Klipw values measured in two laboratories are in an excellent agreement (within 0.14 log units), indicating a high method repeatability. The values of log Klipw and log KBSAw are in the range of 6.3–8.2 and 5.1–7.0, respectively, representing the highest of these partition coefficients measured to date. Log Klipw values for PBDEs are similar to the log of the octanol–water partition coefficients (Kow) (log Klipw − log Kow = −0.06 ± 0.23; mean ± SD of 7 congeners), consistent with the data of chlorobenzenes and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) reported in the literature. No hydrophobicity cutoff was observed for partitioning to the liposome membrane. Log KBSAw values for PBDEs increase linearly with log Kow and do not follow the non-linear trend observed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This difference between PBDEs and PAHs suggests specific binding mechanisms to serum albumin even for hydrophobic compounds.},

However, this approach can lead to underestimations if the capacity of the fluids is insufficient to provide infinite sink conditions. Desorption will then progressively decrease and finally stop when equilibrium between soil and medium is reached. To circumvent this artifact, we incorporated a silicone rod as an absorption sink into the PBET to continuously absorb mobilized contaminants and maintain the desorption gradient. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons served as model contaminants and the colon extended PBET as the extraction model. The inclusion of the silicone rod sink (1) increased the extraction capacity of the test by orders of magnitude, (2) ensured near infinite sink conditions, and (3) allowed for simple back-extraction of PAHs for their quantification by GC-MS. The silicone rod provided fast enrichment when applied to the stomach and small intestine compartment, but was somewhat slower in the richer colon compartment. Finally, the sorptive-PBET was applied to wood soot and a kindergarten soil. The present article provides the basis for how an absorption sink can be integrated into PBET models.},

Nominal concentrations in the aqueous phase corresponding to an effect (or biological activity) are commonly reported and used to characterize toxicity (or biological response). However, the true concentration in the aqueous phase can be substantially different from the nominal. To support in vitro test design and aid the interpretation of in vitro toxicity data, we developed a mass balance model that can be parametrized and applied to represent typical in vitro test systems. The model calculates the mass distribution, freely dissolved concentrations, and cell/tissue concentrations corresponding to the initial nominal concentration and experimental conditions specified by the user. Chemical activity, a metric which can be used to assess the potential for baseline toxicity to occur, is also calculated. The model is first applied to a set of hypothetical chemicals to illustrate the degree to which test conditions (e.g., presence or absence of serum) influence the distribution of the chemical in the test system. The model is then applied to set of 1194 real substances (predominantly from the ToxCast chemical database) to calculate the potential range of concentrations and chemical activities under assumed test conditions. The model demonstrates how both concentrations and chemical activities can vary by orders of magnitude for the same nominal concentration.},

	abstract = {Protein–water partition coefficients (Kpw) of neutral organic chemicals were measured using muscle proteins (from chicken, fish, and pig), collagen and gelatin. Kpw values for these structural proteins were consistently lower than those of bovine serum albumin (BSA), indicating that the use of BSA as a model protein leads to an overestimation of Kpw for structural proteins. Differences in Kpw between chicken, fish, and pig muscle proteins were small. Across the structural proteins, Kpw values were often in the order: muscle proteins {\textgreater} collagen ≥ gelatin. Differences in Kpw between the structural proteins were relatively large ({\textless}2 log units) for nonpolar compounds, and much smaller or insignificant for polar compounds. There were correlations between log Kpw of muscle proteins and log Kow (R2 = 0.83–0.86, SD: 0.35–0.40, n = 45–46). The polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) models fit even better to the data (R2 = 0.95, SD: 0.22). The good model fitting suggests that the reversible binding to muscle proteins can be considered to be nonspecific binding. There was an indication that some chemicals may sorb irreversibly to muscle proteins, which needs further research. We found that the partitioning to muscle protein is typically weaker than that to lipids, but that the protein partitioning of an H-bond donor compound can be as strong as the storage lipid partitioning.},

Storage lipids, made up of triglycerides with various fatty acids, are among the major classes of lipids. Here, we present experimental equilibrium partition data for diverse chemicals in fish oil, linseed oil, and goose fat at 37 °C. These data, in combination with data from the literature for olive oil and milk fat, show that the fatty acid composition of triglycerides has no significant influence on the partition coefficient. This result allows the derivation of a general predictive model for partitioning into storage lipids. We have collected storage lipid/water partition coefficients for 247 compounds to calibrate polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) for 37 °C, which achieved a model fit with a root mean squared error of 0.20 log units. To extend the applicability of this model toward the aquatic food chain, we also measured fish oil partition data at 7 °C. The resulting enthalpies were used to calibrate an additional pp-LFER for the temperature dependence of storage lipid/water partitioning. This model allows us to estimate partition coefficients at desired temperatures that occur under typical ambient conditions.},

	abstract = {A mechanistic mass balance bioconcentration model is developed and parameterized for ionogenic organic chemicals (IOCs) in fish and evaluated against a compilation of empirical bioconcentration factors (BCFs). The model is subsequently applied to a set of perfluoroalkyl acids. Key aspects of model development include revised methods to estimate the chemical absorption efficiency of IOCs at the respiratory surface (EW) and the use of distribution ratios to characterize the overall sorption capacity of the organism. Membrane–water distribution ratios (DMW) are used to characterize sorption to phospholipids instead of only considering the octanol–water distribution ratio (DOW). Modeled BCFs are well correlated with the observations (e.g., r2 = 0.68 and 0.75 for organic acids and bases, respectively) and accurate to within a factor of three on average. Model prediction errors appear to be largely the result of uncertainties in the biotransformation rate constant (kM) estimates and the generic approaches for estimating sorption capacity (e.g., DMW). Model performance for the set of perfluoroalkyl acids considered is highly dependent on the input parameters describing hydrophobicity (i.e., log KOW of the neutral form). The model applications broadly support the hypothesis that phospholipids contribute substantially to the sorption capacity of fish, particularly for compounds that exhibit a high degree of ionization at biologically relevant pH. Additional empirical data on biotransformation and sorption to phospholipids and subsequent incorporation into property estimation approaches (e.g., kM, DMW) are priorities with respect to improving model performance.

	abstract = {Binding to serum albumin has a strong influence on freely dissolved, unbound concentrations of chemicals in vivo and in vitro. For neutral organic solutes, previous studies have suggested a log–log correlation between the albumin–water partition coefficient and the octanol–water partition coefficient (Kow) and postulated highly nonspecific binding that is mechanistically analogous to dissolution into solvents. These relationships and concepts were further explored in this study. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)–water partition coefficients (KBSA/w) were measured for 83 structurally diverse neutral organic chemicals in consistent experimental conditions. The correlation between log KBSA/w and log Kow was moderate, with R2 = 0.76 and SD = 0.43. The log KBSA/w of low-polarity compounds including a series of chlorobenzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased with log Kow linearly up to log Kow = 4–5, but then the linear relationship apparently broke off, and the increase became gradual. The fitting of polyparameter linear free energy relationship models with five solute descriptors was just comparable to that of the log Kow model (R2 = 0.78–0.79, SD = 0.41–0.42); the relatively high SD obtained suggests that solvent dissolution models are not capable of modeling albumin binding accurately. A size limitation of the binding site(s) of albumin is suggested as a possible reason for the high SD. An equilibrium distribution model indicates that serum albumin generally has high contributions to the binding in the serum of polar compounds and relatively small low-polarity compounds, whereas albumin binding for large low-polarity compounds is outcompeted by the strong partitioning into lipids due to low relative affinity of albumin for these compounds.},

	abstract = {Lipids have been considered as the predominant components for bioaccumulation of organic chemicals. However, differences in accumulation properties between different types of lipid (e.g., storage and membrane lipids) have rarely been considered. Moreover, in view of toxic effects on organisms, chemical accumulation specifically in biological membranes is of particular importance. In this review article, partition coefficients of 240 neutral organic compounds between liposomes (phospholipid membrane vesicles) and water (Klipw), reported in the literature or measured additionally for this work, were evaluated. Values of log Klipw and log Kow (octanol–water partition coefficients) differ by 0.4 on average. Polyparameter linear free energy relationships (PP-LFERs) can describe the log Klipw data even better (standard deviations = 0.28–0.31) than the log Kow model. Recent experimental data for highly hydrophobic compounds fit well to the PP-LFERs and do not indicate the existence of a previously postulated “hydrophobicity cutoff”. Predictive approaches based only on the molecular structure (KOWWIN, SPARC, COSMOthermX, COSMOmic) were also evaluated for Klipw prediction. The PP-LFERs revealed that partition coefficients into membrane lipids can be two log units higher than those into storage lipids for H-bond donor compounds, suggesting that distinguishing between the two lipids is necessary to account for the bioaccumulation of these compounds, and that tissues rich in membrane lipids (e.g., kidneys, liver) instead of fat tissue can be the primary phase for accumulation.},

In this study, polyacrylate (PA)-coated fiber was evaluated for its Kfw values toward diverse neutral organic compounds. Literature Kfw data were thoroughly evaluated, and additional Kfw values for 69 compounds were measured in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at 37 °C. These Kfw data, spanning over 6 orders of magnitude, were used to construct polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) models. The PP-LFER models fit well to the data with a standard deviation of 0.15−0.23 log units. Additional experiments indicated that the differences in temperature (25 vs 37 °C), electrolyte concentrations (pure water vs PBS), and conditioning methods (heat vs methanol) had only minor influences ({\textless}0.3 log units) on Kfw. Using the established PP-LFERs, the SPME extraction efficiency of PA coating toward compounds of differing polarity was evaluated in comparison to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) coating. PA exhibited higher extraction capacities for H-bond donor compounds (e.g., phenols, anilines, amides, and many drugs and pesticides) with the estimated Kfw values being 1−4 log units higher than those of PDMS. Also, PA was shown to be more efficient than PDMS for hydrophobic aromatic compounds.},

	abstract = {Analyte affinity capture by surface-immobilized diagnostic agents is a routinely used assay format for profiling numerous medically and technologically important target analytes. These assays suffer from numerous performance limitations, including sensitivity and rapidity. Assay miniaturization is advocated to improve surface-capture performance, specifically exploiting the inverse relationship between analyte flux and capture feature size under mass transfer-limiting capture conditions that characterize many such assay formats. Reduced capture feature sizes, e.g., microarrays, are proposed to overcome mass transfer limitations, yet this is difficult to achieve across several size scales. This study validates certain advantages advocated for capture spot miniaturization using a rationale to understand surface capture miniaturization strategies. Experimentally derived immobilized ligand and target capture densities as a function of microspot size for DNA oligomers immobilized on model gold substrates are compared directly with theoretical analysis, validating the hypothesis that miniaturization yields many practical assay advantages. Specifically, results show that transitions from assay mass transfer limiting to kinetically limiting conditions as feature size decreases identify an optimal microspot size range for a specific bioassay system. Analytical advantages realized from such assay miniaturization are more uniform target-spot coverage and substantially increased rate of capture (hybridization), increasing assay signal and rapidity.},

	abstract = {Electronic nose (e-nose) is a useful tool for gas detection in environment monitoring, food industry and medical diagnosing. It utilizes sensor arrays to generate recognition pattern in identifying odor or specific analyte. Here a novel multimode e-nose is demonstrated for the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by integrating both gravimetric-sensitive sensor and electric-sensitive sensor. In this system, film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) is used to gain mass related information and silicon nanowire field effect transistor (Si-NW FET) to collect electrical related information for the analytes.

	abstract = {The adaptation of semiconductor technologies for biological applications may lead to a new era of inexpensive, sensitive, and portable diagnostics. At the core of these developing technologies is the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET), a biochemical to electrical transducer with seamless integration to electronic systems. We present a novel structure for a true dual-gated ISFET that is fabricated with a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). In contrast to conventional SOI ISFETs, each transistor has an individually addressable back-gate and a gate oxide that is directly exposed to the solution. The elimination of the commonly used floating gate architecture reduces the chance of electrostatic discharge and increases the potential achievable transistor density. We show that when operated in a “dual-gate” mode, the transistor response can exhibit sensitivities to pH changes beyond the Nernst limit. This enhancement in sensitivity was shown to increase the sensor’s signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the device to resolve smaller pH changes. An improved resolution can be used to enhance small signals and increase the sensor accuracy when monitoring small pH dynamics in biological reactions. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the amplified sensitivity and improved resolution result in a shorter detection time and a larger output signal of a loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification reaction (LAMP) targeting a pathogenic bacteria gene, showing benefits of the new structure for biosensing applications.},

Four parameters (e.g., coating material of fiber, temperature and time of extraction, and addition of sodium chloride in the solution) of headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) were optimized, resulting in the best extraction condition including 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber, 45 min and 50 °C of SPME, and 2 g of sodium chloride addition in the wine during the extraction. The SPME had LODs and LOQs ranging from 0.03 to 7.27 μg L−1 and 0.10 to 24.24 μg L−1 for analytic compounds, respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility values were all below 19.8\%, with mean values of 12.7\% and 10.5\%, respectively. Regression coefficients (R2) of detective linearity of the standard curves was higher than 0.9852. Moreover, relative recoveries of analytical targets were achieved in a range of 60.7–125.6\% with good relative standard deviation values (≤20.6\%). In addition, a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the aroma profiles of the wines, which indicated that five samples were distinctly divided into two groups based on their different geographical origins and volatile compounds.},

Moreover, an annual average quality standards as low as 0.4 μg L−1 was set for SCCPs in surface water. Therefore, to test for compliance, the implementation of sensitive and reliable analysis method of SCCPs in water are required. The aim of this work was to address this issue by evaluating automated solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) combined on line with gas chromatography-electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry (GC/ECNI–MS).
Fiber polymer, extraction mode, ionic strength, extraction temperature and time were the most significant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters studied. To determine the suitable factors working ranges, the study of the extraction conditions was first carried out by using a classical one factor-at-a-time approach. Then a mixed level factorial 3 × 23 design was performed, in order to give rise to the most influent parameters and to estimate potential interactions effects between them. The most influent factors, i.e. extraction temperature and duration, were optimized by using a second experimental design, in order to maximize the chromatographic response.
At the close of the study, a method involving headspace SPME (HS-SPME) coupled to GC/ECNI-MS is proposed. The optimum extraction conditions were sample temperature 90 °C, extraction time 80 min, with the PDMS 100 μm fiber and desorption at 250 °C during 2 min.

	abstract = {Microcystins (MCs), a class of potent liver/hepatopancreatic toxins produced by numerous species of freshwater cyanobacteria, are well known for their toxic effects on aquatic organisms and humans. The extraction efﬁciencies of MCs can vary greatly as a result of matrix differences and/or differences in the extraction solvents, techniques, and clean-up steps utilized. Here we report the preparation of a unique internal standard, (S-hydroxypropyl-cys7)microcystin-LR (thiol-LR), with a mass different than any known MCs, which can be spiked into ﬁeld samples and quantiﬁed via HPLC-MS along with endogenous MCs. Thiol-LR is modiﬁed at the Mdha residue, and therefore, provides an accurate measure of only free MCs that are not covalently bound to endogenous thiols in the matrix. The internal standard proved to be a good surrogate for MC-RR, -LR, and -LA in ﬁsh liver tissue. In ﬁsh muscle tissue, thiol-LR was a good surrogate for polar variants, MC-RR and -LR, but was less representative of the non-polar variant, MC-LA. Coupling of the internal standard (8 mg/g ww tissue) with HPLC-MS detection will standardize the quantiﬁcation of free microcystins across species, tissue types, and extraction methods, making the estimation of exposure risk more reliable.},

	abstract = {Human-driven environmental change has increased the occurrence of harmful cyanobacteria blooms in aquatic ecosystems. Concomitantly, exposure to microcystin (MC), a cyanobacterial toxin that can accumulate in animals, edible plants, and agricultural soils, has become a growing public health concern. For accurate estimation of health risks and timely monitoring, availability of reliable detection methods is imperative. Nonetheless, quantitative analysis of MCs in many types of biological and environmental samples has proven challenging because matrix interferences can hinder sample preparation and extraction procedures, leading to poor MC recovery. Herein, controlled experiments were conducted to enhance the use of ultra-performance liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/ MS) to recover MC-LR and MC-RR at a range of concentrations in seafood (ﬁsh), vegetables (lettuce), and environmental (soil) matrices. Although these experiments offer insight into detailed technical aspects of the MC homogenization and extraction process (i.e., sonication duration and centrifugation speed during homogenization; elution solvent to use during the ﬁnal extraction), they centered on identifying the best (1) solvent system to use during homogenization (2–3 tested per matrix) and (2) single-phase extraction (SPE) column type (3 tested) to use for the ﬁnal extraction. The best procedure consisted of the following, regardless of sample type: centrifugation speed = 4200 Â g; elution volume = 8 mL; elution solvent = 80\% methanol; and SPE column type = hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB), with carbon also being satisfactory for ﬁsh. For sonication, 2 min, 5 min, and 10 min were optimal for ﬁsh, lettuce, and soil matrices, respectively. Using the recommended HLB column, the solvent systems that led to the highest recovery of MCs were methanol:water:butanol for ﬁsh, methanol:water for lettuce, and EDTA-Na4P2O7 for soils. Given that the recommended procedures resulted in average MC-LR and MC-RR recoveries that ranged 93 to 98\%, their adoption for the preparation of samples with complex matrices before UPLC–MS/ MS analysis is encouraged.},

Herein, a sensitive, selective and reliable UPLC–MS-MS assay was developed and validated for the quantitative analysis of lorcaserin in rat plasma and brain tissue using carbamazepine as an internal standard (IS). After the extraction of samples by protein precipitation, both lorcaserin and IS were separated on an Acquity BEH™ C18 (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile–10 mM ammonium acetate–formic acid (85:15:0.1, v/v/v) at a ﬂow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Detection and quantiﬁcation were performed on a positive electrospray ionization interface in the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS–MS ion transitions were monitored at m/z 195.99 {\textgreater} 143.91 for lorcaserin and m/z 237.00 {\textgreater} 178.97 for IS, respectively. The calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 1.08–500 ng/mL in plasma and 3.07–500 ng/mL in brain tissue homogenates, respectively. All the validation parameters results were within the acceptable range described in guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. The assay was successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study of lorcaserin after oral administration in rats.},

Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an attractive alternative to immunoassays for the determination of low concentrations of microcystins in tissues. Fish taken from Grand Lake St. Marys, a eutrophic lake in Ohio, USA, were analyzed for microcystin-LR in their fillets using LC-MS/MS. Of 129 fish tested for microcystins, only black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) tested positive for microcystin-LR. Less than 10\% of Pomoxis and 7\% of Cyprinus samples contained measurable levels of microcystin-LR. Statistical analysis yielded a p-value of 0.07 between Pomoxis and the pooled results of the other four fish species. However, this comparison was complicated by the large difference in sample size between species. Further sampling in Grand Lake St. Marys for microcystin-LR would help determine if microcystin-LR exposure occurs through foodweb transfer.},

Bisphenol A (BPA) and its chlorinated derivatives are some of these compounds. In this work, we propose a new liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method to determine these compounds in human placental tissue samples. The method involves an extraction phase of the extracts from the samples using ethyl acetate, followed by a clean-up phase by centrifugation prior to their quantiﬁcation by LC–MS/MS using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface in the negative mode. Deuterated Bisphenol A (BPA-d16) was used as internal standard. Found detection limits (DL) ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ng g−1 and quantiﬁcation limits (QL) from 0.5 to 2.0 ng g−1 for Bisphenol A and its chlorinated derivatives, while inter- and intra-day variability was under 8.1\%. The method was validated using standard addition calibration and a spike recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 97\% to 105\%. This method was satisfactorily applied to the determination of BPA and its chlorinated derivatives in 49 placental tissue samples collected from women who live in the province of Granada (Spain).},

It also includes a review of guidelines values or health-alert levels for cyanotoxins in food (or drinking water) adopted world-wide. The methodological aspects and the queries used in the extensive literature search, the collection and screening of retrieved papers and the inventory are briefly described in the report; all details are available in 3 supplementary appendices to this report. The analysis of collected papers indicated that most of them are focused on a single microcystin (MC) variant (MC-LR) out of the almost 100 MC known. Many studies on occurrence are affected by limited quality, due to analytical drawbacks in the detection methods and were not considered in the exposure assessment. Toxicity studies useful for the derivation of health based reference values are few, being many of them carried out using i.p. injection, which is poorly representative of actual human exposure. In addition, those toxicological studies carried out with poorly characterised cyanobacterial extracts or focused on single parameters, using a single dose, devoted to elucidation of mechanism of action, reporting qualitative description of effects were not used for data extraction. The relevant exposure scenarios are also described, although being the available data on exposure very limited, no definite conclusion on the health risks for the exposed population could be drawn. However, the possibility of risky exposure is evidenced for fish and shell-fish consumers and for blue-green algae supplements (BGAS) as well in relation to MC contamination. Finally, many data gaps were identified.},

Across 11 sites, intracellular, particulate-bound microcystin levels in the seston increased to levels that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water exposure (1 mg toxinÁL–1). In contrast, toxin concentrations in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) muscle tissue (n = 68) declined from June to August, were negatively related to algal toxin levels, and never exceeded a conservative chronic exposure concentration estimated using proposed United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) guidelines. Microcystin concentrations in yellow perch liver exceeded US EPA chronic exposure guidelines, were on average 125 times higher than muscle toxin concentrations per unit dry weight, and varied little throughout the summer. With current guidelines, humans do not appear to be at risk when consuming the muscle tissue of Lake Erie yellow perch collected during large-scale cyanobacterial blooms.

The objective of this review is to provide a broad overview of the main biological samples (urine, blood, plasma, serum, hair, human breast milk, saliva, sweat and skin surface lipids, fecal and tissue), recent advances and applications of various sample preparation methods prior to chromatography, spectrometry and electrochemistry analysis over the past ﬁve years. Novel and modern approaches in biological sample preparation are especially emphasized. Finally, challenges and future perspectives to improve development of sample preparation methods are described.},

The contamination of surface water by these cyanotoxins can cause water quality problems for fisheries, aquaculture, farming, and sanitary hazard for human and animals. Humans may be exposed to cyanobacterial toxins via several routes, including drinking water, recreational contact, some cyanobacteriabased dietary supplements, and food chain. Information on exposure through aquatic food webs, which is generally scarce, is urgently needed and must not be ignored because aquatic organisms could in a direct or indirect manner contribute to food chain cyanotoxin’s transfer, and by the way constitute a potent health risk source.},

Although there was no evidence for microcystin biomagniﬁcation, the fact that microcystins were found in lake water and in the tissues of aquatic organisms, suggests that serious risks to animal and public health are possible to occur.

Mass spectra were extracted from the literature or specially acquired on ESI-Q-ToF and MALDI-ToF/ToF tandem instruments. ESI-MS2 product-ion mass spectra appeared to be rather close to MALDI-ToF/ToF fragment spectra which are uncommon for mass spectral libraries. Testing of the library was based on searches where reference spectra were in turn cross-compared. The percentage of 1st rank correct identiﬁcations (true positives) was 70\% in a general case and 88–91\% without including knowingly defective (‘one-dimension’) spectra as test ones. The percentage of 88–91\% is the principal estimate for the overall performance of this library that can be used in a method of choice for identiﬁcation of individual cyclopeptides and also for group recognition of individual classes of such peptides. The approach to identiﬁcation of cyclopeptides based on mass spectral library matching proved to be the most effective for abundant toxins. That was conﬁrmed by analysis of extracts from two cyanobacterial strains.},

While such blooms in lakes tend to be viewed as a localized phenomenon, there is signiﬁcant potential for downstream export of toxins to freshwater streams, and marine and brackish water environments. However, monitoring for cyanotoxins typically associated with freshwaters, such as the hepatotoxin, microcystin (MC) in marine receiving waters is rare. In 2013 we studied four eutrophic Puget Sound area lakes to assess both toxin transport to marine waters and its potential accumulation in marine shellﬁsh, speciﬁcally mussels. Shellﬁsh beds are extensive throughout Puget Sound, and recreational harvest occurs downstream of our study lakes, so a study goal was to also assess if shellﬁsh consumption poses a human health risk for MC exposure. We conﬁrm, for the ﬁrst time, freshwater to marine transfer of MCs in Puget Sound with subsequent bioaccumulation of MC by mussels. ELISA analysis estimated maximum MC concentrations in source lakes of 2700 μg/L, up to 0.34 μg/L in marine waters and 6.5 μg/kg in mussels. Conﬁrmatory analyses by LC-MS/MS on water and mussel samples identiﬁed MC-LA as the major toxin. Although we found relatively low MC levels in mussels, our study implies that potential concern for human food safety is justiﬁed and warrants further investigation. \& 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Only MCs that have accumulated in animal tissue in reversible interactions are currently considered when estimating risk to higher trophic levels and humans through food web exposure. However, the majority of MCs is likely covalently bound to target proteins in tissues and these MCs are not quantiﬁed or included in these assessments. These covalently bound MCs may be made bioavailable in the digestive system of a consumer through the digestion of their attached protein phosphatase. Three common digestive enzymes, pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, did not digest cyclic MC-LR and MC-LY, but were very active against a control peptide with typical linkages and standard amino acids in ‘‘L’’ conformation, supporting the possibility for MC-peptide formation during gut passage. To test if digestion products could be biologically active in the consumer, four predicted MC-peptides were synthesized and assayed for activity against PP1 by the protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPIA). All four MC-peptides were active against PP1 and comparably half (58\%) as inhibitory as the parent toxin. This in vitro study demonstrated that MCs covalently bound to proteins may represent a reservoir of potential toxicity for consumers.},

The concentrations of MCs in P. rubescens and various zooplanktonic taxa (ﬁlter-feeders and predators) were assessed in different water strata (epi-, meta- and hypolimnion) using replicated sampling over a 24-hour survey. The presence of P. rubescens in the gut content of various zooplanktonic taxa (Daphnia, Bosmina and Chaoborus) was veriﬁed by targeting the cyanobacterial nucleic acids (DNA). These results highlighted that cyanobacterial cells constitute a part of food resource for herbivorous zooplanktonic taxa during metalimnic bloom periods. Furthermore, presence of MCs in Chaoborus larvae highlighted the trophic transfer of MCs between herbivorous zooplankton and their invertebrate predators. Our results suggest that zooplanktonic herbivores by diel vertical migration (DVM) act as vectors of MCs by encapsulating grazed cyanobacteria. As a consequence, they largely contribute to the contamination of zooplanktonic predators, and in ﬁne of zooplanktivorous whiteﬁsh. Indeed, we estimated the relative contribution of three preys of the whiteﬁsh (i.e. Daphnia, Bosmina and Chaoborus) to diet contamination. We showed that Chaoborus and Daphnia were the highest contributor as MC vectors in the whiteﬁsh diet (74.6 and 20.5\% of MC-LR equivalent concentrations, respectively).},

	abstract = {The presence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms have caused severe problems for aquatic animals, wildlife and humans. Monitoring of microcystins (MCs) in fish and other aquatic animals is important for evaluating the potential risk for human consumption. Existing methods for extracting and purifying microcystins in fish tissue are both time- and solvent-consuming. The present study used HLB (0.5 g) and silica gel (2 g)/plus silica gel (0.69 g) tandem cartridges to isolate microcystins from fish tissue samples for subsequent analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). The microcystins (MC-RR, MC-LR) were isolated from a Microcystis bloom in Chikato Pond, Japan, and the purity was confirmed by HPLC. This report has presented a simple and rapid solid phase extraction procedure for determining microcystins in fish tissue, since it yielded high recovery (N 85\%) and consistency (SD b 5\%) in isolating microcystins from fish tissue.},

	abstract = {Microcystins have been detected in raw and ﬁnished drinking water using a variety of techniques, including assays (immunoassay, phosphatase inhibition) and HPLC (UV, MS/(MS)). The principal challenge to microcystin analysis is accounting for the over 150 variants that have been described. A conﬁrmatory individual variant HPLC analysis is prone to under-reporting total microcystins due to method speciﬁcity. One method that allows for total microcystin quantitation is the MMPB technique. In this study, water samples with native microcystins were oxidized to cleave the Adda moiety, common to all microcystin variants. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted on the subsequent MMPB (3-methoxy-2methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid) molecule and calibrated using a certiﬁed reference standard (microcystin-LR) and 4-phenylbutyric acid. Total microcystin concentrations from MMPB were compared to Adda ELISA and individual variant analyses (LC-UV, LC-MS/(MS)). Variants of microcystin, including [DAsp3]MC-RR, [Dha7]MC-RR, MCeRR, MC-YR, MC-LR, [DAsp3]MC-LR, [Dha7]MC-LR, MC-WR, MC-LA, and MC-LY were detected and quantiﬁed in samples. The individual variant analyses did not account for total microcystins present in samples, as indicated by ELISA and MMPB data. Results demonstrated the MMPB technique is a simple and valuable approach to conﬁrm ELISA data when analyzing microcystins, with method detection limits of 0.05 mg LÀ1 for total microcystins.},

	abstract = {A fast and high-throughput method is proposed for the determination of total microcystins ( MC) in environmental surface waters. After a 1-h Lemieux-von Rudloff oxidation step to yield the 2-methyl-3methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB) moiety, samples were quenched, ﬁltered, and directly analyzed. This was achieved via solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled on-line to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometry. The choice of on-line SPE settings was conducted using experimental designs. Given the matrix complexity of oxidation extracts, the on-line desalting step was found to be a critical parameter to ensure suitable method robustness. The on-line sample loading volume was 5 mL, and the wash volume applied for on-line desalting was 3 mL. Instrumental analysis was performed in just 8 min. The method limit of quantiﬁcation was 0.5 ng L−1 MC (i.e. 2000 times lower than the current World Health Organization − WHO drinking water guideline). Excellent determination coefﬁcients were observed for matrix-free and matrix-based calibration curves alike, and the linearity range tested spanned ∼ 4 orders of magnitude. Accuracy and intermediate precision did not depend on the spike level and proved satisfactory (in the range of 93–110\% and 3–6\%, respectively). A thorough assessment of instrumental matrix effects was conducted by comparing standard additions curves in several lake and river oxidation extracts with the matrix-free reference. Regardless of the internal standard used (4-PB or D3-MMPB), instrumental matrix effects were efﬁciently compensated. The matrix effect that may occur at the earlier sample preparation stage was evaluated separately. While the oxidation step was generally not complete (yield ∼ 65\%), the conversion rates of MCs into MMPB remained within a consistent range of values regardless of matrix type. No signiﬁcant back-pressure was observed upon consecutive injections of oxidation-based samples, while the instrumental sensitivity remained unaffected. The herein described method could therefore be eligible for future large-scale monitoring surveys. The method was applied to a selection of surface water samples (n = 30) collected across the province of Québec, Canada, and the results were compared to those achieved by an individual variant analysis of 8 MC congeners and a commercial ELISA kit.},

Even before this protocol was deﬁned, authors already somehow validated their methods without full awareness. They wished to assure the quality of their work. Validation is an applied approach to verify that a method is suitable and rugged enough to function as a quality control tool in different locations and times. The performance parameters and statistical protocols followed throughout a validation study vary with the source of guidelines. Before single laboratory validation, an analytical method should be fully developed and optimized. The purpose of the validation is to conﬁrm performance parameters that are determined during method development, and it should provide information on how the method will perform under routine use. An unstable method may require re-validation. Further method development and optimization will be needed if validation results do not meet the accepted performance standards. When possible, the validation protocol should also be conducted as a collaborative study by multiple laboratories, on different instruments, reagents, and standards. At this point, it would be interesting to know how people are validating their methods. Are they evaluating all deﬁned validation parameters? Are they indicating the followed guidelines? Is re-validation really currently used? Is validation performed by a single laboratory, or is it a collaborative work by several laboratories? Is it an evolving discipline? In this survey, we will try to answer these questions focused to the ﬁeld of liquid chromatography.},

Extraction parameters including volume and pH of eluting solvents, were optimized. Best recoveries were obtained by using 10 mL of 15\% ammonia solution in methanol. The mean recoveries at three concentrations (0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 ␮g g−1 dry weight [DW]) for MC-RR, MC-RR-GSH and MC-RR-Cys were 93.6–99\%, 68.1–73.6\% and 90.0–95.2\%, respectively.

Limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQs) for MC-RR, MC-RR-GSH and MC-RR-Cys were calculated to be 10, 18 and 13 ng g−1 DW, respectively. Finally, this method was successfully applied to the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of MC-RR, MC-RR-GSH and MC-RR-Cys in the liver of bighead carp with acute exposure of MCs.},

Microcystin is known to accumulate in ﬁsh and other aquatic biota, however the prevalence of microcystin in ﬁsh tissue and the human health risks posed by microcystin exposure through ﬁsh consumption remain poorly resolved. Here we show that microcystin is pervasive in water and ﬁsh from several tropical (Ugandan) and temperate (North American) lakes, including lakes that support some of the largest freshwater ﬁsheries in the world. We establish that ﬁsh consumption can be an important and sometimes dominant route of microcystin exposure for humans, and can cause consumers to exceed recommended total daily intake guidelines for microcystin. These results highlight the importance of monitoring microcystin concentrations in ﬁsh, and the need to consider potential exposure to microcystin through ﬁsh consumption in order to adequately assess human exposure risk.},

Therefore, if the analyst is unaware of the linear range of the internal standard and uses a concentration that is outside the linear range, a severe loss of accuracy will occur. The severity is demonstrated through an example and precautions to prevent this problem are suggested.

It has been a widely discussed topic in electro-spray mass spectrometry where the ionization suppression is a major problem in accurate quantitative analysis. However, the unique strength of mass spectrometry to detect and quantify accurately a co-eluting stable isotope labelled internal standard offers an easy solution to the ionization suppression problem. Given the fact that it is impossible to match the matrix of the calibration standards with all samples, mass spectrometry allows accurate quantitation without the need for matrix matching, as long as the internal standard co-elutes with the analyte of interest. If the analyte and internal standard co-elute, the slope of the calibration curve analyte response/internal standard vs. analyte concentration is independent of the matrix composition, eliminating the need for matrix matching.},

The accumulation of MCs in ﬁsh living in different trophic levels from different parts of Lake Taihu was determined. This information was then used to evaluate the risks posed by the MCs in ﬁsh to human health. The concentrations of three MCs, MC-LR, MC-YR and MC-RR, were quantiﬁed in the following four ﬁsh species: silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), crucian carp (Carassius auratus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), using high performance liquid chromatography interfaced with tandem (triple quadrupole) mass spectrometry. The mean concentrations of MCs in the muscle, the kidney, the intestinal wall and the heart were signiﬁcantly different among the four ﬁshes except in the liver. C. carpio contained the highest mean concentration of MCs in the muscle (31.7 ± 12.1 ng/g, dry mass (dm)), whereas C. auratus had the highest mean concentrations of MCs in the liver (45.4 ± 44.5 ng/g, dm), kidney (114 ± 51.1 ng/g, dm), intestinal wall (2.04 × 103 ± 4.43 × 103 ng/g, dm) and heart (59.5 ± 26.7 ng/g, dm). The mean concentration of MCs in the intestinal walls of the ﬁsh species was signiﬁcantly higher than in other organs (p b 0.01). The ﬁsh from Meiliang Bay had signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of MCs than those from the centre, west or south banks of the lake (p b 0.01). The body lengths and masses of the ﬁsh were negatively correlated with the concentrations of MCs in the kidney (p b 0.05) and heart (p b 0.01). The average daily intake (ADI) of MCs in the muscle of all ﬁshes exceeded the provisional tolerable daily intake (TDI) set by World Health Organization. The estimated daily intakes of MCs in 55.6\% of the muscle samples exceeded the TDI.

	abstract = {Microcystins are cyanobacterial hepatotoxins capable of accumulation into animal tissues. The toxins act by inhibiting speciﬁc protein phosphatases and both non-covalent and covalent interactions occur. The 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB) method determines the total, i.e. the sum of free and protein-bound microcystin in tissues. The aim of the method development in this paper was to tackle the problems with the MMPB methodology: the rather laborious workﬂow and the loss of material during different steps of the method. In the optimised workﬂow the oxidation recovery was of acceptable level (29–40\%), the extraction efﬁciency good (62–97\%), but the signal suppression effect from the matrix remained severe in our system (16–37\% signal left). The extraction efﬁciency for the determination of the free, extractable microcystins, was found to be good, 52–100\%, depending on the sample and the toxin variant and concentration.},

These ﬁshes are harvested and sold both for local human consumption and for export. The presence of MC-RR, MC-LR and MC-YR in different organs (gut, muscle and liver) was determined using Liquid Chromatography coupled with a Mass Spectrometry Detector (LC/ MS/MS). The total MCs in ON gut, muscle and liver were 1312.08, 208.65 and 73.10 ng gÀ1 from L. Mburo and 1479.24, 9.65 and 48.07 ng gÀ1 from Murchison Bay, respectively, while for LN from Murchison Bay they were 27.78, 1.86 and 3.74 ng gÀ1. Generally, in both lakes, MC-RR was the most dominant followed by MC-YR and MC-LR, respectively. Gut showed a high MC content, followed by liver and muscle, in that order. The presence of MCs in muscle indicated possible ﬁsh contamination, which implied that it was possible to transfer the toxins to humans who are at the end of the food chain. This poses a risk to them since the MCs are heat stable. The local authorities should warn the public of the risk of possible poisoning by eating the contaminated ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are a group of cyclic heptapeptides originating from cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria also produce a range of peptides and other compounds that can result in complex chromatograms when samples are analyzed by LC-MS. Derivatization with appropriate thiols (e.g., mercaptoethanol) of the oleﬁn in the α,β-unsaturated amide present in most microcystins was shown to simplify analysis of LC-MS chromatograms of sample extracts, making it much easier to identify peaks corresponding to candidate microcystins. Furthermore, interpretation of MS2 spectra was facilitated by addition of the mass associated with the thiol to the α,β-unsaturated amide of microcystins. Cyanotoxins containing Mdha or Dha reacted readily with thiols, whereas Mser, Ser, Mdhb, and thiol-derivatives of Mdha or Dha did not react under the conditions used. This approach therefore provides a convenient LC-MS method to obtain evidence for the presence of Mdha or Dha and can likely be used to diﬀerentiate between the isobaric amino acids Mdha and Dhb in candidate cyanotoxin peaks. When O-(2-mercaptoethyl)-O′-methyl-hexa(ethylene glycol) (MEMHEG) (Mwt. 356) was used as the thiol, the resulting derivatives eluted in an LC-MS mass window that was largely free of interferences. This approach simpliﬁes detection of candidate microcystin analogues even in the presence of complex mixtures of coeluting components. The method was used for qualitative analysis of a Microcystis aeruginosa culture from Lake Naivasha, Kenya, and the results were veriﬁed using precursor-ion scanning and high-resolution mass spectrometry.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are potent cyclic heptapeptide toxins found in some cyanobacteria, and usually contain an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group that is readily conjugated to thiol-containing amino acids, peptides, and proteins in vivo and in vitro. Methods for deconjugating these types of adducts have recently been reported, but the reactions are slow or result in derivatized microcystins. Mercaptoethanol derivatives of a range of microcystins were therefore used as model compounds to develop deconjugation procedures in which the dialkyl sulﬁde linkage was oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone that, when treated with base, rapidly eliminated the adducted thiol as its sulfenate or sulﬁnate via β-elimination to aﬀord free microcystins with the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group intact. These free microcystins can be analyzed by LC/MS to determine the toxin proﬁle of bound microcystins. The method was tested on Cys- and GSH-derivatives of [Dha7]MC-LR. In solution, the deconjugation reactions were complete within minutes at pH 10.7 and within a few hours at pH 9.2. Oxidation of sulﬁdes to sulfoxides is easier and more rapid than oxidation to sulfones, allowing the use of milder oxidants and shorter reaction times. Oxidation of any methionine residues present in the microcystins occurs inevitably during these procedures, and interpretation of the microcystin proﬁle obtained by LC/MS analysis needs to take this into account. Oxidation of tryptophan residues and degradation of microcystins by excess oxidant were circumvented by the addition of Me2SO as a sacriﬁcial reducing agent. These methods may be useful for other compounds that undergo conjugation via thia-Michael addition, such as acrylamide and deoxynivalenol. Oxidation of sulﬁdes to sulfoxides can occur in vivo and could aﬀect the bioavailability of toxins and drugs conjugated via thia-Michael addition, potentially exacerbating oxidative stress by catalytically converting GSH to its sulfenate via conjugation, oxidation, and elimination to regenerate the free toxin.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are potent cyclic heptapeptide toxins found in many freshwater cyanobacteria. Most microcystins contain an α,β-unsaturated amide that can react with thiolcontaining amino acids, peptides, and proteins in vivo and in vitro. While soluble conjugates formed from small peptides can be extracted and analyzed directly by LC−MS, microcystins conjugated to proteins are analyzed after oxidative cleavage of their Adda side chains, but information on which microcystin analogues were present is lost. Observations during the development of thiol-derivatization-based LC−MS methods for microcystin analysis indicated that the reaction of thiols with microcystins was reversible. The kinetics of deconjugation was investigated with mercaptoethanol as a model thiol to identify suitable reaction conditions. A range of microcystins conjugated to mercaptoethanol, methanethiol, cysteine, and glutathione were then successfully deconjugated, demonstrating the feasibility of releasing conjugated forms of microcystins for chemical analysis. Reagents for removing the released thiols or for trapping the released microcystins increased the reaction rate. Optimization of methodologies based on this reaction should increase the method’s utility for measuring free and conjugated microcystins. The results also indicate that thiol-conjugated microcystins slowly release free microcystins, even at neutral pH, with consequences for assessment of toxin exposure, metabolism, and trophic transfer. A range of other common natural and environmental toxins, such as deoxynivalenol and acrylamide, also contain α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups and can be expected to behave in a similar manner.},

	abstract = {Many eutrophic inland freshwater lakes in the Puget Sound Washington region produce toxic cyanobacteria blooms annually. While such blooms in lakes tend to be viewed as a localized phenomenon, there is signiﬁcant potential for downstream export of toxins to freshwater streams, and marine and brackish water environments. However, monitoring for cyanotoxins typically associated with freshwaters, such as the hepatotoxin, microcystin (MC) in marine receiving waters is rare. In 2013 we studied four eutrophic Puget Sound area lakes to assess both toxin transport to marine waters and its potential accumulation in marine shellﬁsh, speciﬁcally mussels. Shellﬁsh beds are extensive throughout Puget Sound, and recreational harvest occurs downstream of our study lakes, so a study goal was to also assess if shellﬁsh consumption poses a human health risk for MC exposure. We conﬁrm, for the ﬁrst time, freshwater to marine transfer of MCs in Puget Sound with subsequent bioaccumulation of MC by mussels. ELISA analysis estimated maximum MC concentrations in source lakes of 2700 μg/L, up to 0.34 μg/L in marine waters and 6.5 μg/kg in mussels. Conﬁrmatory analyses by LC-MS/MS on water and mussel samples identiﬁed MC-LA as the major toxin. Although we found relatively low MC levels in mussels, our study implies that potential concern for human food safety is justiﬁed and warrants further investigation. \& 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Extraction and detection of MC-LR from the water and ﬁsh samples was conducted by the SPE and HPLC-UV apparatus.

The results indicated that MC-LR content in water ranged from 0.18 to 3.02 μg/L in dissolved fraction and undetectable level to 1.13 μg/L in cellular fraction, in all three seasons. The results of PCA revealed that the environmental parameters including EC, Chl-a, PO43-, pH and temperature were the most effective factors inﬂuencing the MC-LR production. Results further showed the mean concentration of MC-LR in muscle and liver of silver carp ranged from 10.12 to 40.98 and from undetectable to 44.34 μg/kg w.w, respectively. The mean concentration of MC-LR in northern pike was 15.18 to 35.1 μg/kg w.w in muscle and undetectable to 51.91 μg/kg w.w in liver samples. Our results suggest that consumption of ﬁsh harvested from the Anzali wetland seems to be unsafe for humans, based on obtained estimated daily intake values which were higher than the tolerable daily intake value recommended by WHO. In addition, bioaccumulation factor of MC-LR in edible tissues of ﬁsh was estimated based on lipid normalization. The results showed that the BAF of MC-LR in silver carp (1047 ± 185 L/kg of lipid) was lower than the northern pike (1272 ± 185 L/kg of lipid), although the difference was not signiﬁcant.},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by ﬁlamentous fungi. Primary route of human exposure to mycotoxins is the intake of the contaminated food. Minimizing mycotoxin exposure is important for population health, as their chronic toxic effects have been associated with kidney and liver diseases, some types of cancer and immunosuppression. The objective of this work was to develop and validate a multiclass mycotoxin method suitable for exposure monitoring of mycotoxins in human plasma. A sensitive liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry method was developed for 17 mycotoxins: nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol, fusarenon X, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, aﬂatoxin B1, aﬂatoxin B2, aﬂatoxin G1, aﬂatoxin G2, zearalenone, ␣-zearalenol (␣-ZOL), ␤-zearalenol, zearalanone, ␣-zeranol and, and ␤-zeranol. The method relies on three-step liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate to eliminate the need for immunoafﬁnity extraction and minimize ionization matrix effects. Chromatographic separation of mycotoxins, including all isomers, was achieved with pentaﬂuorophenyl column and water/methanol mobile phase. Mycotoxin detection and quantitation were performed using high-resolution mass spectrometry on LTQ Velos Orbitrap, in both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI(+) and (ESI(−)). The use of 0.02\% acetic acid as mobile phase additive for ESI(−) resulted in signiﬁcant increase in ionization efﬁciency ranging from 1.7 to 26 times for mycotoxins that ionize better in ESI(−). The optimized method was validated according to FDA guidance procedures. LOQs of all mycotoxins ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml, except NIV which resulted in LOQ of 3 ng/ml because of low extraction recovery of this highly polar mycotoxin. Mean intra-day accuracy ranged from 85.8\% to 116.4\%, and intra-day precision (n = 6) ranged from 1.6\% to 12.5\% RSD for all mycotoxins except ␣-ZOL where mean accuracy ranged from 72.9\% to 97.2\%. Inter-day accuracy and precision were 85.6\%–111.5\% and 2.7–15.6\% RSD respectively, showing good analytical performance of the method for biomonitoring. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A simple, rapid UHPLC-MS/MS method has been developed and optimised for the quantitation of microcystins and nodularin in wide variety of sample matrices. Microcystin analogues targeted were MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-LA, MC-LY, MC-LF, LC-LW, MC-YR, MC-WR, [Asp3] MC-LR, [Dha7] MC-LR, MC-HilR and MC-HtyR. Optimisation studies were conducted to develop a simple, quick and eﬃcient extraction protocol without the need for complex pre-analysis concentration procedures, together with a rapid sub 5 min chromatographic separation of toxins in shellﬁsh and algal supplement tablet powders, as well as water and cyanobacterial bloom samples. Validation studies were undertaken on each matrix-analyte combination to the full method performance characteristics following international guidelines. The method was found to be speciﬁc and linear over the full calibration range. Method sensitivity in terms of limits of detection, quantitation and reporting were found to be signiﬁcantly improved in comparison to LC-UV methods and applicable to the analysis of each of the four matrices. Overall, acceptable recoveries were determined for each of the matrices studied, with associated precision and within-laboratory reproducibility well within expected guidance limits. Results from the formalised ruggedness analysis of all available cyanotoxins, showed that the method was robust for all parameters investigated. The results presented here show that the optimised LC-MS/MS method for cyanotoxins is ﬁt for the purpose of detection and quantitation of a range of microcystins and nodularin in shellﬁsh, algal supplement tablet powder, water and cyanobacteria. The method provides a valuable early warning tool for the rapid, routine extraction and analysis of natural waters, cyanobacterial blooms, algal powders, food supplements and shellﬁsh tissues, enabling monitoring labs to supplement traditional microscopy techniques and report toxicity results within a short timeframe of sample receipt. The new method, now accredited to ISO17025 standard, is simple, quick, applicable to multiple matrices and is highly suitable for use as a routine, high-throughout, fast turnaround regulatory monitoring tool.},

	abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are hepatotoxic cyanobacterial metabolites produced sporadically in aquatic environments under favorable environmental conditions. Afﬁnity of these toxins to covalently bind with protein phosphatases poses a challenge in their detection. Lemieux oxidation to release 2-methyl-3methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB), a common moiety to all MCs congeners, has been used in detection of these compounds, however a lack of sensitivity has limited the usefulness of the method. In this study, modiﬁcations of the oxidation and solid phase extraction procedures, combined with a sensitive LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) detection, have resulted in 25 ng/g method detection limits in both liver and plasma samples. Samples harvested from six ﬁngerling channel catﬁsh (Ictalurus punctatus) dosed intraperitoneally with a sublethal MC-LR dose of 250 mg/kg were analyzed, and microcystin concentrations ranging from 370 to 670 ng/g in plasma and 566e1030 ng/g in liver were detected. Similarly, 250 mg/kg nodularin-dosed channel catﬁsh ﬁsh were found to contain 835 e1520 ng/g in plasma and 933e1140 ng/g in liver. Detection of the toxins in serum and liver combined with the presence of histopathological lesions consistent with these hepatocellular toxin in exposed ﬁsh and no positive ﬁndings in the control ﬁsh demonstrates the usefulness of this analytical procedure for the diagnosis of suspected algal toxicity cases.},

Whereas transcriptional studies of the biosynthetic genes suggest a clear inﬂuence of light conditions on toxin production the data for the metabolite itself are inconsistent and highly strain-speciﬁc. Here, we have reassessed the MC content by using two immunological detection techniques that allow a parallel quantiﬁcation of MC in the methanolic extracts and the residual pellet fraction that contains high molecular weight proteins. Our results show a signiﬁcant proportion of MC in the protein bound fraction in strains of Microcystis and Planktothrix and of the related toxin nodularin (NOD) in Nodularia. Moreover, we could show a very strong increase of MC after high light illumination in the protein fraction contributing to a signiﬁcant overall increase in MC production under these conditions that is not seen in extracts analysed by LC-MS and ELISA. The fact that a considerable portion of MC is neglected with current analysis techniques was also conﬁrmed for selected ﬁeld samples. Immunoﬂuorescence studies suggest strain-speciﬁc differences in the amount of MC conjugate formation.},

These are potent and highly specific hepatotoxins, the toxicity of which is based upon their inhibition of type-1 (PP1) and type-2A (PP2A) protein phosphatases. Apart from protein phosphatases, it is not known whether these phosphataseinhibiting peptides could bind any other cellular proteins. We wanted to determine whether any possible unknown MC-adducts could explain the apoptotic effects observed at high concentrations of MCs. The question of other possible cellular proteins binding to MCs is also relevant when these compounds are employed for affinity purification of protein phosphatases. In MC-treated cell lysates, antibodies to MC recognized three protein adducts of 35 Á/37 and 55 kD. By immunochemical and proteomics approaches, these proteins were identified as the catalytic subunits of type-1 and type-2A protein phosphatases and the ATP-synthase betasubunit. The latter target could be associated with the suggested apoptosis-inducing potential of MCs.},

The isoelectric point of proteins is not affected by their interaction with microcystin-LR, even though the presence of microcystin-LR alters the pool of peptides obtained by tryptic digestions. Under the conditions tested, microcystin-LR does not exhibit afﬁnity for DNA.

The results showed that the free MC per cell remained constant, while the quantity of protein-bound MCs increased with the growth of Microcystis cells in both kinds of culture. Signiﬁcant changes in the dominant MC-bound proteins occurred in the late exponential growth phase of batch cultures, while the dominant MC-bound proteins in semi-continuous cultures remained the same. In ﬁeld samples collected at different months in Lake Taihu, the dominant MC-bound proteins were shown to be similar, but the amount of protein-bound MC varied and correlated with the intracellular MC content. We identiﬁed MC-bound proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis immunoblots and mass spectrometry. The 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL was a prominent MC-bound protein. Three essential glycolytic enzymes and ATP synthase alpha subunit were also major targets of MC-binding, which might contribute to sustained growth in semi-continuous culture.

Factors affecting ion intensities, including matrix concentration and laser intensity, were investigated to optimize sensitivity of the method. Microcystins and nodularin were analyzed for femtomolar sensitivity (about 2.5 pg microcystin-LR in 2 ml water). Samples of blood sera and liver tissue were spiked with microcystin-LR and analyzed. The detection limit was 1 ng in 2 ml blood sera solution. Reactions of microcystins by compounds containing mercaptan groups, such as dithiothreitol, aminoethanethiol and protein phosphatase 1, were examined on the chip by mass spectrometry. Formation of the microcystin–dithiothreitol conjugate was used to conﬁrm the target compounds. The MS/MS data obtained showed the presence of the microcystin conjugate.

Average recoveries of spiked fish samples were 67.7\% for MC-RR, 85.3\% for MC-YR, and 88.6\% for MC-LR. The MCs (MC-RR + MC-YR + MC-LR) concentration in liver and gut content was highest in phytoplanktivorous fish, followed by omnivorous fish, and was lowest in carnivorous fish; while MCs concentration in muscle was highest in omnivorous fish, followed by phytoplanktivorous fish, and was lowest in carnivorous fish. This is the first study reporting MCs accumulation in the gonad of fish in field. The main uptake of MC-YR in fish seems to be through the gills from the dissolved MCs. The WHO limit for tolerable daily intake was exceeded only in common carp muscle. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are cyanobacterial toxins that represent a serious threat to drinking water and recreational lakes worldwide. Here, we show that microcystin fulfils an important function within cells of its natural producer Microcystis. The microcystin deficient mutant DmcyB showed significant changes in the accumulation of proteins, including several enzymes of the Calvin cycle, phycobiliproteins and two NADPH-dependent reductases. We have discovered that microcystin binds to a number of these proteins in vivo and that the binding is strongly enhanced under high light and oxidative stress conditions. The nature of this binding was studied using extracts of a microcystin-deficient mutant in vitro. The data obtained provided clear evidence for a covalent interaction of the toxin with cysteine residues of proteins. A detailed investigation of one of the binding partners, the large subunit of RubisCO showed a lower susceptibility to proteases in the presence of microcystin in the wild type. Finally, the mutant defective in microcystin production exhibited a clearly increased sensitivity under high light conditions and after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Taken together, our data suggest a protein-modulating role for microcystin within the producing cell, which represents a new addition to the catalogue of functions that have been discussed for microbial secondary metabolites.},

We examined the dynamic change in extracellular free MCs, intracellular free MCs and protein-bound MCs in both batch cultures and semi-continuous cultures, using high performance liquid chromatography and Western blot. The results showed that the free MC per cell remained constant, while the quantity of protein-bound MCs increased with the growth of Microcystis cells in both kinds of culture. Signiﬁcant changes in the dominant MC-bound proteins occurred in the late exponential growth phase of batch cultures, while the dominant MC-bound proteins in semi-continuous cultures remained the same. In ﬁeld samples collected at different months in Lake Taihu, the dominant MC-bound proteins were shown to be similar, but the amount of protein-bound MC varied and correlated with the intracellular MC content. We identiﬁed MC-bound proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis immunoblots and mass spectrometry. The 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL was a prominent MC-bound protein. Three essential glycolytic enzymes and ATP synthase alpha subunit were also major targets of MC-binding, which might contribute to sustained growth in semi-continuous culture. Our results indicate that protein-bound MC may be important for sustaining growth and adaptation of Microcystis sp.},

Even so, few studies have quantiﬁed MCs in Lake Erie ﬁshes, and these studies have drawn different conclusions concerning the risk that ﬁsh consumption poses to public health. To address this gap in knowledge, we used Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) to evaluate the MC concentration in muscle tissue from three commonly harvested ﬁsh in Lake Erie: walleye (Sander vitreus, n = 29); yellow perch (Perca ﬂavescens, n = 52); and white perch (Morone americana, n = 55), collected during summer 2013. Satellite remote sensing was used to compare MC concentrations in ﬁsh tissue to bloom conditions in Lake Erie at the time of harvest. We found a signiﬁcant difference among mean MC concentrations in walleye (71 ng MC/g wet weight), white perch (37 ng MC/g), and yellow perch (8.1 ng MC/g). In addition, MC levels in white perch appeared to depend on local bloom conditions. While few of the ﬁsh collected contained MC in excess of WHO guidelines, our results indicate that more toxic blooms could increase MC in ﬁsh to levels that pose a greater risk to public health.},

Hatchery rainbow trout were added to an enclosure in Lake Rotoiti where concentrations of microcystins in the phytoplankton and cyanobacterial cell concentrations could be closely monitored. Rainbow trout that were free to roam in the entire area of each lake were also included in the study. Freshwater mussels were suspended subsurface in cages in the enclosure. Phytoplankton samples, rainbow trout liver and muscle tissue, and the tissues of mussels were analyzed for microcystins using the ADDA-ELISA method, and selected samples were analyzed using LC-MS. A maximum concentration of microcystins in the phytoplankton samples of 760  g LÀ1 was recorded in Te Weta Bay, Lake Rotoiti, in March 2004. ELISA results conﬁrmed microcystin immunoreactivity in rainbow trout liver and muscle tissues and in freshwater mussels. The microcystin congeners LR, YR, RR, AR, FR, LA, and WR were detected by LC-MS in caged freshwater mussels in Lake Rotoiti but were not detected in either muscle or liver tissue of rainbow trout. The daily tolerable intake limit of microcystins for human consumption recommended by the World Health Organisation is 0.04  g kgÀ1 dayÀ1. Modeling was carried out for the human intake of microcystin compounds from rainbow trout muscle tissue, and the potential health risks were estimated, assuming the ADDA-ELISA was determining compounds of toxicity equivalent to microcystinLR. \# 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Among all ﬁsh, intestines and blood had the highest average content of MC-RR þ MC-LR (22.0 and 14.5  g gÀ1 DW, respectively), followed by liver, bile, and kidney (7.77, 6.32, and 5.81  g gÀ1 DW, respectively), whereas muscle had the least (1.81  g gÀ1 DW). MC content in muscle was highest in carnivorous ﬁsh (Culter ilishaeformis, 2.22  g gÀ1 DW) and omnivorous ﬁsh (Carassius auratus, 1.96  g gÀ1 DW) and was lowest in phytoplanktivorous ﬁsh (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, 1.65  g gÀ1 DW) and herbivorous ﬁsh (Parabramis pekinensis 0.660  g gÀ1 DW). However, the amount of MC in the gut of H. molitrix (137  g gÀ1 DW) was more than 20 times that in the other ﬁsh ({\textless}6.50  g gÀ1 DW). The MCs showed a tendency to accumulate up the food chain, and piscivorous ﬁsh at the top of the food chain were at high risk of exposure to MCs in Lake Chaohu. Our study is the ﬁrst to report MC concentrations in the bile and blood of wild ﬁsh. One hundred grams of ﬁsh muscle would contain 2.64–49.7  g of MC-LR equivalent, or about 1.3–25 times the recommended tolerable daily intake of MC-LR by humans, indicating that ﬁsh are already severely contaminated by MCs and that the local authorities should warn the public of the risk of poisoning by eating the contaminated ﬁsh.

	abstract = {Introduction  Global metabolomics analyses using body fluids provide valuable results for the understanding and prediction of diseases. However, the mechanism of a disease is often tissue-based and it is advantageous to analyze metabolomic changes directly in the tissue. Metabolomics from tissue samples faces many challenges like tissue collection, homogenization, and metabolite extraction.
Objectives  We aimed to establish a metabolite extraction protocol optimized for tissue metabolite quantification by the targeted metabolomics AbsoluteIDQ™ p180 Kit (Biocrates). The extraction method should be non-selective, applicable to different kinds and amounts of tissues, monophasic, reproducible, and amenable to high throughput.
Methods  We quantified metabolites in samples of eleven murine tissues after extraction with three solvents (methanol, phosphate buffer, ethanol/phosphate buffer mixture) in two tissue to solvent ratios and analyzed the extraction yield, ionization efficiency, and reproducibility.
Results  We found methanol and ethanol/phosphate buffer to be superior to phosphate buffer in regard to extraction yield, reproducibility, and ionization efficiency for all metabolites measured. Phosphate buffer, however, outperformed both organic solvents for amino acids and biogenic amines but yielded unsatisfactory results for lipids. The observed matrix effects of tissue extracts were smaller or in a similar range compared to those of human plasma.
Conclusion  We provide for each murine tissue type an optimized high-throughput metabolite extraction protocol, which yields the best results for extraction, reproducibility, and quantification of metabolites in the p180 kit. Although the performance of the extraction protocol was monitored by the p180 kit, the protocol can be applicable to other targeted metabolomics assays.},

	abstract = {Background: Toxic cyanobacterial blooms (Microcystis aeruginosa contains microcystins [MCs]) have been reported to induce clinicopathological alterations as well as different oxidative stress in aquatic biota. Aim: Three-week subchronic exposure experiment was carried out on Nile tilapia, to determine their effects on fish behavior, tissues, liver functions, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation. Materials and Methods: Fish were exposed to four main treatments; orally fed diet plus toxic cells of M. aeruginosa (containing 3500 µg/g MC-LR), immersion in 500 µg MC-LR/L, intraperitoneal injection of M. aeruginosa MC-LR with a dose of 0.1 ml of extracted toxin at a dose of 200 μg/kg bwt, and the fourth one served as a control group, then the fish were sacrificed at the end of 3rd week of exposure.
Results: The results revealed no recorded mortality with obvious behavioral changes and an enlarged liver with the congested gall bladder. Histopathology demonstrated fragmentation, hyalinization, and necrosis of the subcutaneous musculature marked fatty degeneration, and vacuolation of hepatopancreatic cells with adhesion of the secondary gill lamellae associated with severe leukocytic infiltration. Furthermore, liver functions enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, lipid peroxidase, and catalase enzymes) were significantly increased in all treatments starting from the 2nd week as compared to the control levels.
Conclusion: In this context, the study addresses the possible toxicological impacts of toxic M. aeruginosa contain MC-LR to Nile tilapia, and the results investigated that MC-LR is toxic to Nile tilapia in different routes of exposure as well as different doses.},

In recent years, evidence that both free and bound fractions of toxin are found in these tissues has highlighted the need to develop effective methods of quantiﬁcation. Several techniques do exist, but only the Lemieux oxidation has so far been used to investigate complex tissue matrices. In this study, protocols based on the Lemieux approach were adapted for the quantitative chemical analysis of free MC-LR and MMPB derived from bound toxin in the tissues of juvenile trout gavaged with MC-LR. Afterwards, the NF V03 110 guideline was used to characterize the protocols elaborated and evaluate their effectiveness.},

The present paper studied seasonal changes of MC content (determined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) in various organs of three species of bivalves (Cristaria plicata, Hyriopsis cumingii, and Lamprotula leai) in Lake Taihu, China, where toxic cyanobacterial blooms occurred. Coinciding with peaks of seston MC (maximum, 5.7 ␮g/L) and MC in cyanobacterial blooms (maximum, 0.534 mg/g), most organs showed sharp MC peaks during the summer, indicating both fast uptake and fast depuration by bivalves. Because hepatopancreas and intestine had considerably higher MC content than other organs, they are the most dangerous for human consumption. Both the present and previous studies show that the hepatopancreatic MC and total tissue MC often are correlated in various aquatic invertebrates. During the peak of the cyanobacterial blooms, C. plicata had higher hepatopancreatic MC content than the other bivalves, whereas H. cumingii had higher intestinal MC content than the other bivalves. Estimated daily intakes for humans from the consumption of whole tissues of the three bivalves were 0.48 to 0.94 ␮g MC-LR equivalent/kg body weight (12- to 23.5-fold the tolerable daily intake value proposed by the World Health Organization), which indicates a high risk for humans consuming these bivalves.},

Wild Nile and redbreast tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia rendalli) were sampled from the catch of artisanal ﬁshermen at eutrophic stations of Funil and Furnas reservoirs in southeastern Brazil. Phytoplankton communities in the two reservoirs were quite different taxonomically, but not dissimilar in microcystin content (200 mg g dry weight (DW) sestonÀ1 at Funil, 800 mg gDW sestonÀ1 at Furnas). All of the 27 ﬁsh sampled contained microcystin, ranging from 0.8 to 32.1 mg g liverÀ1 and from 0.9 to 12.0 ng g muscleÀ1. Most microcystin variants found in seston were also found in ﬁsh liver. T. rendalli had the lowest concentration in both tissues when compared to O. niloticus. In both reservoirs, one of every four ﬁsh sampled, always O. niloticus, had a level of microcystins beyond the World Health Organization tolerable daily intake (8 ng g tissueÀ1) and represented a risk for consumers. It is possible that closer study of inter-species variability in toxin burden in cyanobacteria-impacted water bodies will permit the development of guidelines for ﬁsh consumption that will better protect public health.},

Moreover, there is a large number of unknown microcystins that could potentially exist in the environment resulting from different amino acid substitutions into the microcystin skeletal structure. To tackle these problems, the present study involved the development of a high throughput method based on on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography that could provide quantitative results for 12 microcystin variants (LR, YR, RR, HtyR, HilR, WR, LW, LA, LF, LY, Dha7-LR, and Dha7-RR) and anatoxin-A in less than 3 h with detection limits between 0.004 and 0.01 μg L−1 and expanded uncertainty between 4 and 14\%. Datadependent acquisition was employed for the non-targeted analysis of these cyanotoxins. Filtering the data based on structure diagnostic fragments, two unknown microcystin variants not previously reported in the literature were detected. The structures Leu1-microcystin-Met(O)R and Leu1microcystin-LY were fully characterized by accurate mass measurement, collision-induced dissociation, and fragmentation prediction software.},

MCs accumulate in aquatic organisms probably as a result of irreversible binding to liver protein phosphatases. The aim of this study was to describe the recovery of MC from ﬁsh liver using various detection methods, with MC-LR as the representative congener. These ﬁndings are discussed in conjunction with the current procedures and limit values used for human risk assessment. Following incubation of liver homogenates with various MC-LR concentrations, the homogenates were extracted by a water/ methanol/butanol mixture via different treatments and subsequently analyzed via the colorimetric protein phosphatase inhibition assay (cPPA), HPLC, and anti-Adda ELISA. Detection via cPPA appeared to yield the highest recovery of MC-LR, although the presence of unspeciﬁc background may have resulted in overestimation of the true recovery. The recoveries determined via HPLC and anti-Adda ELISA were comparable to each other. The limits of detection were 0.01–2.4  g MC-LR/g liver tissue, depending on the method used. Maximum MC-LR recovery from samples incubated with 10 and 100  g MC-LR/g ranged between 44\% and 101\%. Recovery from samples incubated with 1  g MC-LR/g liver tissue was below 3\%. Lower recovery is assumed to result from irreversible, covalent MC protein binding, as conﬁrmed by Western blotting of liver homogenates with anti-Adda immunoprobing. The results demonstrate that further investigation of and improvement in routinely applied MC methods for ﬁsh tissue and/or food analyses are needed for a reliable risk assessment.

The most immediate concern for people and animals are cyanobacterial toxins, which have been detected at variable concentrations in water and ﬁsh around the world. Cyanotoxins can transfer through food webs, potentially increasing the risk of exposure to people who eat ﬁsh from affected waters, yet little is known about how cyanotoxins ﬂuctuate in wild ﬁsh tissues. We collated existing studies on cyanotoxins in ﬁsh and fresh water from lakes around the world into a global dataset to test the hypothesis that cyanotoxin concentrations in ﬁsh increase with water toxin concentrations. We limited our quantitative analysis to microcystins because data on other cyanotoxins in ﬁsh were sparse, but we provided a qualitative summary of other cyanotoxins reported in wild, freshwater ﬁsh tissues. We found a positive relationship between intracellular microcystin in water samples and microcystin in ﬁsh tissues that had been analyzed by assay methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and protein phosphatase inhibition assay). We expected microcystin to be found in increasingly higher concentrations from carnivorous to omnivorous to planktivorous ﬁshes. We found, however, that omnivores generally had the highest tissue microcystin concentrations. Additionally, we found contrasting results for the level of microcystin in different tissue types depending on the toxin analysis method. Because microcystin and other cyanotoxins have the potential to impact public health, our results underline the current need for comprehensive and uniform detection methods for the analysis of cyanotoxins in complex matrices.},

	abstract = {Freshwater aquaculture ponds are important artificially regulated aquatic ecosystems which provide a large number of freshwater fish products in China. The cyanobacteria bloom and microcystin (MC) pollution caused by anthropogenic eutrophication have attracted much attention due to their toxic effects. To provide an insight into the cyanobacterial problem in the ponds, the environmental parameters and MCs of a typical artificial pond in the Yangtze River Delta region of China were monitored and studied from May to December 2015. During the monitoring period, the ponds were in serious eutrophication with total phosphorus (TP) concentrations between 0.95 and 1.80 μg/L, and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations between 1.1 and 4.86 μg/L. High feed coefficient and high fish stock were the main reasons for the eutrophication. The results showed that the water temperature was the key factor that affected the cyanobacteria blooming in the pond. The chlorophyll a concentration was significantly positively correlated with the cyanobacteria density during the blooming season. MC-LR and MC-RR existed simultaneously and showed a significant positive correlation. The peak concentrations of dissolved MC-LR and MC-RR in the pond water were 40.6 and 4.7 μg/L, respectively, which is considered highly toxic. Free MC-LR and MC-RR were also found in the aquaculture products. MC-LR concentrations in the bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) liver and shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) muscle were up to 2.64 and 4.17 μg/kg, respectively.

	abstract = {MC analysis of biological tissue is considered to be very difﬁcult due to the lack of validated methods. This is the primary limiting factor for monitoring potential risks in both the ﬂesh of aquatic organisms and the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, an effective method to determine free MCs (MC-LR and MC-RR) in the muscle and liver tissues of freshwater cultured ﬁsh was developed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The extraction solvent, time of extraction, eluent and puriﬁcation of the extract were optimized. Various SPE cartridges were also investigated. In this optimized analytical procedure, an 85\% methanol/water solution (v/v) was selected as the extraction solvent, after which the extracts were puriﬁed by removing fats and proteins; a HLB cartridge was chosen for MCs enrichment; and 90\% methanol containing 0.02\% formic acid/water solution (v/v) was used as the eluent. Under the optimized pretreatment conditions and instrument parameters, good recoveries of MCLR and MC-RR were obtained at three concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg g¡1 dry weight (DW)), with values ranging from 92.5 to 98.3\% and 92.1 to 98.6\%, respectively. The method detection limit (MDL) for muscle samples was 0.5 mg kg¡1 and 0.4 mg kg¡1 (DW) for MC-LR and MC-RR, respectively. The MDL for the liver samples was 0.8 mg kg¡1 (DW) for both MC-LR and MC-RR. The developed procedure was successfully applied to analyze MCs in the muscle and liver of ﬁsh samples collected from a Chinese freshwater aquaculture pond during bloom seasons. The MC-LR concentrations ranged from below the MDL to 4.17 mg kg¡1 and the MC-RR concentrations ranged from below the MDL to 2.64 mg kg¡1.},

	abstract = {Microcystins, toxins produced by cyanobacteria, may play a role in ﬁsh kills, although their speciﬁc contribution remains unclear. A better understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of microcystins is hampered by a lack of analyses at different trophic levels in lake foodwebs. We present 3 years of monitoring data, and directly compare the transfer of microcystin in the foodweb starting with the uptake of (toxic) cyanobacteria by two different ﬁlter feeders: the cladoceran Daphnia galeata and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. Furthermore foodwebs are compared in years in which the colonial cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa or the ﬁlamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii dominated; there are implications in terms of the types and amount of microcystins produced and in the ingestion of cyanobacteria. Microcystin concentrations in the seston commonly reached levels where harmful effects on zooplankton are to be expected. Likewise, concentrations in zooplankton reached levels where intoxication of ﬁsh is likely. The food chain starting with Dreissena (consumed by roach and diving ducks) remained relatively free from microcystins. Liver damage, typical for exposure to microcystins, was observed in a large fraction of the populations of different ﬁsh species, although no relation with the amount of microcystin could be established. Microcystin levels were especially high in the livers of planktivorous ﬁsh, mainly smelt. This puts piscivorous birds at risk. We found no evidence for biomagniﬁcation of microcystins. Concentrations in ﬁlter feeders were always much below those in the seston, and yet vectorial transport to higher trophic levels took place.},

	abstract = {IntroductionEssential oils are known to possess antimicrobial activity; thus, their use has played an important role over the years in medicine and for food preservation purposes.ObjectiveThe effect of clove oil and its major constituents as bactericidal agents on the global metabolic profiling of E. coli bacteria was assessed by means of metabolic alterations, using solid phase microextraction (SPME) as a sample preparation method coupled to complementary analytical platforms.MethodE. Coli cultures treated with clove oil and its major individual components were sampled by HS-SPME-GCxGC-ToF/MS and SPME-UPLC–MS. Full factorial design was applied in order to estimate the most effective antibacterial agent towards E. coli. Central composite design and factorial design were applied to investigate parameters influencing metabolite coverage and efficiency by SPME.ResultsThe metabolic profile, including 500 metabolites identified by LC–MS and 789 components detected by GCxGC-ToF/MS, 125 of which were identified as dysregulated metabolites, revealed changes in the metabolome provoked by the antibacterial activity of clove oil, and in particular its major constituent eugenol. Analyses of individual components selected using orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis showed a neat differentiation between control samples in comparison to treated samples in various sets of metabolic pathways.ConclusionsThe combination of a sample preparation method capable of providing cleaner extracts coupled to different analytical platforms was successful in uncovering changes in metabolic pathways associated with lipids biodegradation, changes in the TCA cycle, amino acids, and enzyme inhibitors in response to antibacterial treatment.},

Application of main techniques widely used for preparation of a variety of coating materials of SPME, including sol-gel technique, electrochemical and electrospinning methods as well as the available commercial coatings, were presented. Advantages and limitations of each technique from several aspects, such as range of application, biocompatibility, availability in different geometrical configurations, method of preparation, incorporation of various materials to tune the coating properties, and thermal and physical stability, were also investigated. Future perspectives of each technique to improve the efficiency and stability of the coatings were also summarized.

	abstract = {Liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) is widely used as a pre-treatment technique for separation and preconcentration of both organic and inorganic analytes from aqueous samples. Nevertheless, it has several drawbacks, such as emulsion formation or the use of large volumes of solvents, which makes LLE expensive and labour intensive. Therefore, miniaturization of conventional liquid–liquid extraction is needed. The search for alternatives to the conventional LLE using negligible volumes of extractant and the minimum number of steps has driven the development of three new miniaturized methodologies, i.e. single-drop microextraction (SDME), hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME). The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of these novel preconcentration approaches and their potential use in analytical labs involved in inorganic (ultra)trace analysis and speciation. Relevant applications to the determination of metal ions, metalloids, organometals and non-metals are included.},

	abstract = {Modern gas monitoring scenarios for medical diagnostics, environmental surveillance, industrial safety, and other applications demand new sensing capabilities. This Review provides analysis of development of new generation of gas sensors based on the multivariable response principles. Design criteria of these individual sensors involve a sensing material with multiresponse mechanisms to different gases and a multivariable transducer with independent outputs to recognize these different gas responses. These new sensors quantify individual components in mixtures, reject interferences, and offer more stable response over sensor arrays. Such performance is attractive when selectivity advantages of classic gas chromatography, ion mobility, and mass spectrometry instruments are canceled by requirements for no consumables, low power, low cost, and unobtrusive form factors for Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, and other applications. This Review is concluded with a perspective for future needs in fundamental and applied aspects of gas sensing and with the 2025 roadmap for ubiquitous gas monitoring.},

In spite of many available methods, only few publications report on-site analyses of soil samples by SPME. To date, the only application of SPME for the on-site quantification of organic pollutants in soil has been devoted to trichloroethylene. The problem of matrix effects limiting quantification by external standard calibration is discussed. Efficiencies of available approaches for decreasing and controlling matrix effects are evaluated and compared. SPME from a soil sample headspace with internal standard calibration was identified as one of the promising approaches to achieve fast, simple, precise, and accurate on-site quantification of a wide range of organic pollutants in soil. Cold-fiber SPME has a significant development potential, because it is capable of providing lowest detection limits together with a minimum matrix effect. Perspectives for future development of the field are outlined.},

	abstract = {In chemical analysis, sample preparation is frequently considered the bottleneck of the entire analytical method. The success of the final method strongly depends on understanding the entire process of analysis of a particular type of analyte in a sample, namely: the physicochemical properties of the analytes (solubility, volatility, polarity etc.), the environmental conditions, and the matrix components of the sample. Various sample preparation strategies have been developed based on exhaustive or non-exhaustive extraction of analytes from matrices. Undoubtedly, amongst all sample preparation approaches, liquid extraction, including liquid–liquid (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE), are the most well-known, widely used, and commonly accepted methods by many international organizations and accredited laboratories. Both methods are well documented and there are many well defined procedures, which make them, at first sight, the methods of choice. However, many challenging tasks, such as complex matrix applications, on-site and in vivo applications, and determination of matrix-bound and free concentrations of analytes, are not easily attainable with these classical approaches for sample preparation. In the last two decades, the introduction of solid phase microextraction (SPME) has brought significant progress in the sample preparation area by facilitating on-site and in vivo applications, time weighted average (TWA) and instantaneous concentration determinations. Recently introduced matrix compatible coatings for SPME facilitate direct extraction from complex matrices and fill the gap in direct sampling from challenging matrices. Following introduction of SPME, numerous other microextraction approaches evolved to address limitations of the above mentioned techniques. There is not a single method that can be considered as a universal solution for sample preparation. This review aims to show the main advantages and limitations of the above mentioned sample preparation approaches and the applicability and capability of each technique for challenging cases such as complex matrices, on-site applications and automation.},

Here, both systems are discussed theoretically and evaluated based on experimental data. Experimental comparisons were conducted in terms of extraction recovery, sensitivity, and selectivity for the extraction of doping agent compounds (logP: 0.14–4.98), using C18 as the extraction phase. The extraction recovery of both systems was studied at different volumes of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The distribution constant of SPME in thin-film geometry (i.e., thin-film microextraction/TFME) as well as the retention factor and breakthrough volume for the SPE system were evaluated for the simultaneous extraction of polar and non-polar compounds. Using 1mL of sample, the extraction recovery and sensitivity of the SPE system (100mg sorbent) was comparable with that of TFME format of SPME (15mg sorbent) for all analytes, with the exception of most polar compounds, due to the smaller amount of the extraction phase in SPME. Breakthrough in the SPE system was observed for more polar compounds in a 25mL sample; however, this situation did not affect the quantitation of TFME, as this technique operates in equilibrium mode. Experimental values for breakthrough volume were in good match with the calculated theoretical values. Results indicate that the microextraction approach is more suitable for untargeted determinations, where the breakthrough volume cannot be determined prior to the experiment. In addition, when both methods are at optimum conditions, findings suggest that, despite the smaller volume of the extraction phase in TFME, the sensitivity of TFME can exceed that of SPE for samples where the target analytes vary substantially in polarity.},

	abstract = {Sample preparation procedures in use in many application areas are still tedious and manually intensive protocols. These characteristics mean that sample treatment is considered the most time-consuming and error-prone part of the analytical scheme. The increasing demand for faster, more cost-effective and environmental friendly analytical methods is a major incentive to improve these conventional procedures and has spurred research in this field during the last decades. This review provides an overview of the most relevant developments and successful approaches proposed in recent years concerning sample preparation. The current state-of-the-art is discussed on the basis of examples selected from representative application areas and involving conventional instrumental techniques for the final determination of the target compounds. Emphasis will be on those techniques and approaches that have already demonstrated their practicality by the analysis of real-life samples, and in particular on those dealing with the determination of minor organic components. The potential of the latest developments in this field for sample treatment simplification and complete hyphenation and integration of analytical process is discussed and the most pressing remaining limitations evaluated.},

	abstract = {Stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) was introduced in 1999 as a solventless sample preparation method for the extraction and enrichment of organic compounds from aqueous matrices. The method is based on sorptive extraction, whereby the solutes are extracted into a polymer coating on a magnetic stirring rod. The extraction is controlled by the partitioning coefficient of the solutes between the polymer coating and the sample matrix and by the phase ratio between the polymer coating and the sample volume. For a polydimethylsiloxane coating and aqueous samples, this partitioning coefficient resembles the octanol–water partitioning coefficient. In comparison to solid phase micro-extraction, a larger amount of sorptive extraction phase is used and consequently extremely high sensitivities can be obtained as illustrated by several successful applications in trace analysis in environmental, food and biomedical fields. Initially SBSE was mostly used for the extraction of compounds from aqueous matrices. The technique has also been applied in headspace mode for liquid and solid samples and in passive air sampling mode. In this review article, the principles of stir bar sorptive extraction are described and an overview of SBSE applications is given.},

In the past two decades, a large number of ‘modern’ sample-preparation techniques has been introduced, which have partly superseded their ‘classical’ counterparts. These novel techniques include off-line and on-line (sometimes semi- or fully automated) procedures, and exhaustive extraction as well as equilibrium techniques. In order to improve overall performance, aspects such as essentially organic solvent-less approaches, large-volume injection and miniaturization receive increasing attention. In most recent applications, mass spectrometric or element-selective detection have been used. The present review discusses the advantages and disadvantages, and relative performance, of most of the modern sample-preparation techniques and cites a number of illustrative applications for each of them.},

In this study, the use of polyacrylate SPME fibers is investigated for the purpose of biomimetic extractions, a procedure used to simulate bioconcentration and to estimate total concentrations in aquatic organisms. Experimental SPME−water partition coefficients correlate well with octanol−water and membrane−water partition coefficients, indicating that these passive sampling devices provide a good surrogate for lipid partitioning. On the basis of these relationships, the total internal concentration resulting from exposure to an aqueous sample can be estimated from the total moles of chemicals that sorb to the fiber. The aquatic toxicity of the sample is then predicted by comparison to critical internal concentrations that elicit adverse effects. This procedure offers a number of practical advantages over previous biomimetic extraction techniques (e.g., Empore disk) due to faster sorption kinetics, smaller sample volumes, and applicability to volatile compounds.},

Additionally, differences between the n-octanol/water and membrane/water partition coefficients are explored using a small selection of calculated descriptors. The results from both these models show that besides the partitioning between an organic phase and water, additional hydrogen-bonding parameters (εLUMO, Q-, and Q+) should be taken into account. Finally, using structural fragment values, a QSPR was derived to correct the n-octanol/water partition coefficient to obtain membrane/water partition coefficients, in case that obtaining AM1 descriptors is not feasible. The QSPRs that are presented here include only alcohols, benzenes, anilines, phenols, nitrobenzenes, quinoline, esters, and amines. Due to the data limitation, the models should be regarded preliminary for other structures, and caution is necessary when modeling charged species.},

In the current paper, the partitioning behavior of organic chemicals from water to polyacrylate coating is described in terms of a two-compartment model and first-order kinetics. Experimental results show that, through agitation, it is possible to achieve a sufficiently small aqueous diffusion layer around the fiber to prevent aqueous diffusion from being the limiting factor in the absorption process. This then implies that the equilibration time is completely determined by the polyacrylate phase. In addition, the kinetic rate constants derived from the experimental results, viz. the uptake rate constant and polyacrylate−water partition coefficient, are modeled by multivariate techniques, using physicochemical and quantum chemical descriptors. These models clearly show that, besides hydrophobicity expressed as the octanol−water partition coefficient, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (and related properties) and the most positive charge on any hydrogen atom in the molecule are important descriptors. This indicates that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in polyacrylate−water partitioning. The models that are presented can be used to predict absorption profiles of organic chemicals to polyacrylate-coated fibers, thereby giving the opportunity to predict the kinetics (including equilibration times) by computations alone.},

Currently applied techniques, like solvent extraction, have the disadvantage of extracting the total amount of a compound that is present in a sample. For many applications, though, the freely dissolved fraction of a compound is of more interest than the overall amount. The procedure described in this work is based on the principle that only the freely dissolved compound is available for partitioning to the SPME fiber. By extracting only a small amount of the freely dissolved fraction, the equilibrium between the fraction of a compound bound to a matrix and the fraction dissolved in the aqueous phase is not perturbed. The procedure was applied to study the binding of four polar compounds, i.e., aniline, nitrobenzene, 4-chloro-3-methylphenol, and 4-n-pentylphenol, to bovine serum albumin to illustrate the possibilities of the method.},

	abstract = {A characterisation of a system designed for active sampling of gaseous compounds with Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) fibres is described. This form of sampling is useful to automate sampling while considerably reducing the sampling times. However, the efficiency of this form of sampling is also prone to be affected by certain undesirable effects such as fibre saturation, competition or displacement effects between analytes, to which particular attention should be paid especially at high flow rates. Yet, the effect of different parameters on the quantitivity of the results has not been evaluated. For this reason, in this study a careful characterisation of the influence of the parameters involved in active sampling SPME has been performed. A versatile experimental set-up has been designed to test the influence of air velocities and fluid regime on the quantitivity and reproducibility of the results. The mathematical model applied to the calculation of physical parameters at the sampling points takes into consideration the inherent characteristics of gases, distinctive from liquids and makes use of easily determined experimental variables as initial/boundary conditions to get the model started. The studies were carried out in the high-volume outdoor environmental chambers, EUPHORE. The sample subjected to study was a mixture of three aldehydes: pentanal, hexanal and heptanal and the determination methodology was O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine hydrochloride (PFBHA) on-fibre derivatisation. The present work proves that the determination procedure is quantitative and sensitive, independent from experimental conditions: temperature, relative humidity or ozone levels. With our methodology, the influence on adsorption of three inter-related variables, i.e., air velocity, flow rate and Reynolds numbers can be separated, since a change can be exerted in one of them while keeping the others constant.},

With this calibration method, all analytes can be directly calibrated with only two samplings. The feasibility of this calibration method was validated in a standard aqueous solution flow-through system and a standard gas flow-through system. The distribution coefficients of five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, anthracene, and pyrene, between water and the PDMS fiber coating were determined and the concentrations of the PAHs in the flow-through system were successfully calibrated with the proposed standard-free calibration method. The extracted amounts of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbezene, o-xylene) at equilibrium were also successfully calibrated with this method with two rapid sampling periods at 5 and 10 s. Compared with the previous calibration methods for rapid on-site analysis by SPME, this method does not require a standard to calibrate the extraction, nor does it require additional equipment to control or measure the flow velocity of the sample matrix. In addition, all of the extracted analytes can be quantified without considering whether the system reached equilibrium. The newly proposed standard-free kinetic calibration approach enriched the calibration methods available for on-site analysis by SPME.},

The current study examined the potential use of solid-phase microextraction fibers as a matrix-independent approach to predict the toxicity of permethrin to Daphnia magna across various water sources, including a laboratory reconstituted water, two natural waters, and a modified natural water. Water source strongly affected the toxicity of permethrin as well as the concentration–response relationships. Although permethrin concentrations in the water were predictive of toxicity to D. magna for individual water sources, there was no relationship between permethrin concentrations among water sources and mortality. This indicated that compositional differences among water sources can greatly influence toxicity, suggesting that benchmarks established using reconstituted water may be overly conservative for some natural waters. In addition, although permethrin tissue residues were predictive of mortality for individual waters, the correlation among waters was not as clear. Finally, both 48-h and equilibrium-based SPME fiber concentrations adequately predicted toxicity independent of water properties. This demonstrated that bioavailability-based estimates provided a more accurate prediction of toxicity than water concentrations and that SPME fibers could be used in environmental monitoring as a rapid and accurate means of predicting toxicity in natural waters.},

The observed EC50 values (pyrene concentration causing 50\% inhibition of reproduction) were 14mg/kg and 31mg/kg (dry mass) for these soils, corresponding to equilibrium porewater concentrations of 37μg/L and 47μg/L, respectively. Differences in organic carbon content were not sufficient to explain the variability in toxicity between the different soils. Soils causing a significant inhibition of reproduction were further amended with 10\%-compost, 5\%-biochar, or both, and the effects on reproduction and porewater concentration determined. Combined addition of compost and biochar was identified as the most effective strategy in reducing pyrene concentration in soil porewater, which was also partly reflected in soil toxicity. However, porewater concentrations predicted only 52\% of pyrene toxicity to nematodes, pointing to particle-bound or dietary exposure pathways.

	abstract = {In this study, the bioavailability of DDTr (sum of DDT, DDD and DDE isomers) in pesticide-contaminated soil was assessed using an in vivo mouse model. DDTr relative bioavailability (RBA) ranged from 18.7±0.9 (As35) to 60.8±7.8\% (As36) indicating that a significant portion of soil-bound DDTr was not available for absorption following ingestion. When DDTr bioaccessibility was assessed using the organic Physiologically Based Extraction Test (org-PBET), the inclusion of a sorption sink (silicone cord) enhanced DDTr desorption by up to 20-fold (1.6–3.8\% versus 18.9–56.3\%) compared to DDTr partitioning into gastrointestinal fluid alone. Enhanced desorption occurred as a result of the silicone cord acting as a reservoir for solubilized DDTr to partition into, thereby creating a flux for further desorption until equilibrium was achieved. When the relationship between in vivo and in vitro data was assessed, a strong correlation was observed between the mouse bioassay and the org-PBET+silicone cord (slope=0.94, y-intercept=3.5, r2=0.72) suggesting that the in vitro approach may provide a robust surrogate measure for the prediction of DDTr RBA in contaminated soil.},

SPME fibers within steel mesh envelopes were exposed statically via direct burial within sediment. Six fiber types (polymer coatings) were tested. Polyacrylate (PA) SPME fiber was sufficiently durable for this application, yielded the lowest detection limits, and exhibited a linear uptake relationship across toxicologically relevant sediment NA concentrations (100−2000 nmol/g dw (20−500 μg/g dw)). Temperature greatly influenced SPME absorption kinetics. Via evaluation of absorption at different temperatures, recommended sampling times needed to achieve steady-state equilibrium were 48 h for room temperatures (23−25 °C) and up to 7 d for cold (5 °C) temperatures. Although a comparison of TNT residues by SPMEs and TNT bioavailability and toxicity in sediments has not been completed, differences in SPME availability of TNT and its degradation products were found between two different TNT-spiked sediments. Our disposable SPME technique was slightly less expensive and as precise as the conventional extraction for total NAs and may prove to be a powerful exposure evaluation tool for assessing the ecological risk of these compounds.},

In this study, the use of polyacrylate SPME fibers is investigated for the purpose of biomimetic extractions, a procedure used to simulate bioconcentration and to estimate total concentrations in aquatic organisms. Experimental SPME−water partition coefficients correlate well with octanol−water and membrane−water partition coefficients, indicating that these passive sampling devices provide a good surrogate for lipid partitioning. On the basis of these relationships, the total internal concentration resulting from exposure to an aqueous sample can be estimated from the total moles of chemicals that sorb to the fiber. The aquatic toxicity of the sample is then predicted by comparison to critical internal concentrations that elicit adverse effects. This procedure offers a number of practical advantages over previous biomimetic extraction techniques (e.g., Empore disk) due to faster sorption kinetics, smaller sample volumes, and applicability to volatile compounds.},

A procedure involving acid insoluble ash (AIA) content was combined with homogenization and centrifugation techniques to divide total earthworm Cd burdens into supernatant (metallothionein-bound), pellet (toxicologically active), and soil-associated Cd fractions. Whereas the supernatant fraction of the earthworm digests increased linearly throughout the exposure period (from approximately 0 to 3.59 mmol/kg), the pellet fraction reached a steady-state concentration (95\% CI) of 1.2 (0.9–1.4) mmol/kg, suggesting the ability of the metallothionein detoxification system to sequester incoming Cd. The AIA method was useful for correcting earthworm Cd concentrations for ingested soil-associated Cd and observing soil ingestion, which was suppressed in Cd-spiked artificial soil (1.06 (0.57–1.55)\%) compared to controls (17.25 (14.36–20.15)\%). These methods may be useful in investigating soil ingestion and Cd uptake and detoxification in earthworms.},

	abstract = {Permeability/performance reference compounds (PRCs) are analytically noninterfering organic compounds with moderate to high fugacity from semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) that are added to the lipid prior to membrane enclosure. Assuming that isotropic exchange kinetics (IEK) apply and that SPMD−water partition coefficients are known, measurement of PRC dissipation rate constants during SPMD field exposures and laboratory calibration studies permits the calculation of an exposure adjustment factor (EAF). In theory, PRC-derived EAF ratios reflect changes in SPMD sampling rates (relative to laboratory data) due to differences in exposure temperature, membrane biofouling, and flow velocity−turbulence at the membrane surface. Thus, the PRC approach should allow for more accurate estimates of target solute/vapor concentrations in an exposure medium. Under some exposure conditions, the impact of environmental variables on SPMD sampling rates may approach an order of magnitude. The results of this study suggest that most of the effects of temperature, facial velocity−turbulence, and biofouling on the uptake rates of analytes with a wide range of hydrophobicities can be deduced from PRCs with a much narrower range of hydrophobicities. Finally, our findings indicate that the use of PRCs permits prediction of in situ SPMD sampling rates within 2-fold of directly measured values.},

An agarose gel model was used as semi-solid tissue surrogate, to mimic changes in matrix tortuosity as expected in tissue. Pork muscle was used as tissue source and was loaded with diazepam or amitriptyline using 24h incubation in spiked phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Diazepam is neutral and its behavior is predictable based on the octanol–water partition coefficient (Kow). Amitriptyline is {\textgreater}99\% positively charged at pH 7.4, and is likely to behave differently in both agarose gel and tissue compared to neutral compounds. The proposed SPME method yielded detectable fiber concentrations after direct sampling in agarose gel and loaded tissue, including short sampling times and different loading concentrations in tissue. Sorption affinity of both diazepam and amitriptyline is decreased when sampling from agarose gel compared to PBS, due to the presence of different binding groups in agarose. Sorption affinities from tissue are even further decreased compared to agarose gel. This indicates that tissue contains even more binding sites for these compounds compared to agarose gel. Interestingly, for both compounds, equilibration in tissue occurred faster than equilibration in agarose gel or PBS, most likely caused by direct fiber contact or through facilitated transport. Although more research is needed to obtain good quantitative results, these results show that the C18/SCX fiber is a sensitive tool to determine tissue concentrations of neutral and cationic compounds.},

In this study, we investigated the effect of complex matrix on the extraction kinetic of SPME for biological sample analysis. Two sample matrices, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and agarose gel with BSA were used to simulate the biological fluid and tissue. Results showed that the addition of BSA significantly enhanced the mass transfer of organic compounds onto SPME fiber in both PBS buffer and gel sample. Enhancement factors ranging from 1.3 to 27, and 2.0 to 80 were found for all selected polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PBS buffer and agarose gel with BSA concentration of 0.1–5\%, respectively. Then, an improved theoretical model was applied to quantify the observed enhancement effect, and the result showed that the predicted sampling time constant agreed well with the experimental one in complex matrix. Furthermore, a simplified equation was proposed for the real biological sample analysis.},

We also examine spatial and temporal resolution and associated technical parameters, such as sampling time and dimensions of the SPME probe. Relative to other in vivo sampling techniques, such as microdialysis, in vivo tissue collection or biosensors, SPME has distinct advantages in its simplicity and its ability to sample simultaneously various tissues and locations in a single fish in a relatively non-invasive, timely and cost-effective manner.

However, the calibration of PE-SPME is often time-consuming and requires deuterated calibrants, which if available, are often expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a simple but versatile kinetic calibration method, in which nonisotopic (label-free) compounds of interest can supplant the use of deuterated analogues, and the need to determine partitioning coefficients inherent to earlier procedures has been eliminated. Using this approach, both free and total concentrations of analytes can be simultaneously measured within complex sample systems with high accuracy and precision. This calibration method was validated against established E-SPME and solid-phase extraction techniques through the measurement of selected pharmaceuticals in progressively complex matrixes including inorganic buffers, fish blood, and municipal wastewater effluents. This calibration approach may significantly improve time and cost-effectiveness, while improving the application of the SPME approach within highly dynamic systems.},

The polystyrene/collagen core–sheath nanofiber membrane was coaxially electrospun and strengthened with in situ glutaraldehyde cross-linking. This membrane not only kept high mass transfer rate, large extraction capacity and biomatrix resistance as our previously proposed membrane (Anal. Chem. 2013, 85 (12), 5924–5932), but also got much better mechanical strength and stability in water. The microfluidic device was designed to sandwich the membrane, and the blood in vivo can be introduced into it and get contact with the membrane repetitively. With this membrane and device, a 2-min equilibrium in vivo extraction method was established, validated in a simulated blood circulation system, and was used to monitor the pharmacokinetic profiles of desipramine in rabbits. The free and total concentration of desipramine in vivo was monitored with 10-min interval almost without rabbit blood consumed.

	abstract = {In vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) can be used to sample the circulating blood of animals without the need to withdraw a representative blood sample. In this study, in vivo SPME in combination with liquid–chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was used to determine the pharmacokinetics of two drug analytes, R,R-fenoterol and R,R-methoxyfenoterol, administered as 5mgkg−1 i.v. bolus doses to groups of 5 rats. This research illustrates, for the first time, the feasibility of the diffusion-based calibration interface model for in vivo SPME studies. To provide a constant sampling rate as required for the diffusion-based interface model, partial automation of the SPME sampling of the analytes from the circulating blood was accomplished using an automated blood sampling system. The use of the blood sampling system allowed automation of all SPME sampling steps in vivo, except for the insertion and removal of the SPME probe from the sampling interface. The results from in vivo SPME were compared to the conventional method based on blood withdrawal and sample clean up by plasma protein precipitation. Both whole blood and plasma concentrations were determined by the conventional method. The concentrations of methoxyfenoterol and fenoterol obtained by SPME generally concur with the whole blood concentrations determined by the conventional method indicating the utility of the proposed method. The proposed diffusion-based interface model has several advantages over other kinetic calibration models for in vivo SPME sampling including (i) it does not require the addition of a standard into the sample matrix during in vivo studies, (ii) it is simple and rapid and eliminates the need to pre-load appropriate standard onto the SPME extraction phase and (iii) the calibration constant for SPME can be calculated based on the diffusion coefficient, extraction time, fiber length and radius, and size of the boundary layer. In the current study, the experimental calibration constants of 338.9±30mm−3 and 298.5±25mm−3 are in excellent agreement with the theoretical calibration constants of 307.9mm−3 and 316.0mm−3 for fenoterol and methoxyfenoterol respectively.},

	abstract = {The success of in vivo solid phase microextraction (SPME) depends significantly on the selection of calibration method. Three kinetic in vivo SPME calibration methods are evaluated in this paper: (1) on-fibre standardization (OFS), (2) dominant pre-equilibrium desorption (DPED), and (3) the diffusion-based interface (DBI) model. These are compared in terms of precision, accuracy, and ease of experimental use by employing a flow device simulating an animal circulatory system. In addition, the kinetic calibration methods were validated against established SPME equilibrium extraction (EE) external calibration and a conventional sample preparation method involving protein precipitation. The comparison was performed using a hydrophilic drug fenoterol as the analyte of interest. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was used for the determinations. All three kinetic methods compared well with both EE extraction and the conventional method in terms of accuracy (93–119\%). In terms of precision, the DBI model had the best precision in whole blood and buffered phosphate saline solution with \%RSD similar to the standard techniques (9–15\%). DPED had the poorest precision of \%RSD (20–30\%) possibly due to errors associated with uncertainty in the amount of standard loaded on-fibre and remaining on the fibre after desorption. In addition, incurred errors could result due to the greater number of fibres used in comparison to the other two calibration methods. The precision of the OFS procedure was better than for DPED primarily because the use of multiple fibres is eliminated. In terms of the ease of use for calibration, the DBI model was the simplest and most convenient as it did not require standards once it had been calibrated or the uptake constant was calculated. This research suggests the potential use of DBI model as the best kinetic calibration method for future in-vein blood SPME investigations.},

Here, for the first time, the uptake and elimination behaviors, as well as the transferable capacities, of SMs in living edible biota (fish and aloe) were revealed. Fish muscle was approximately 100–2000 times more efficient in accumulating SMs than was aloe leaf, and nitro musks showed a higher bioaccumulation potential than did polycyclic musks in biota. In addition, the transferable capabilities of SMs by root uptake in aloe were poor. This investigation also showed that both nitro musks and polycyclic musks that accumulated in biota exhibited excellent elimination rates in clean water, and the elimination rates were greater than 78\% and 80\% in fish (3d) and aloe (2d), respectively. Furthermore, the calculated results suggest that SMs might act as chemosensitizers and enhance the accumulation of normally excluded toxicants in biota in a real aquatic environment.},

	abstract = {The presence of off-flavor compounds in fish represents a significant economic problem encountered in aquaculture production. The off-flavor compounds are due to the absorption of substances produced by a range of microorganisms. Currently, a number of strategies have been used to prevent or limit the growth of these microorganisms. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies via monitoring the concentrations of off-flavor compounds in the recirculating aquaculture system. In vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME), a rapid and simple sample preparation method, will allow monitoring the concentration of off-flavor compounds in live fish. In this research, geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) produced by cyanobacteria and actinomycetes, which are the major sources for “earthy” and “muddy” flavors in fish, were selected as representatives. In order to accurately quantify these compounds in fish muscle, two kinetic calibration methods, on-fiber standardization and measurement using predetermined sampling rate, were used as quantification methods, which were both validated by traditional methods. The detection limit of in vivo SPME in fish muscle was 0.12 ng/g for geosmin and 0.21 ng/g for 2-MIB, which are both below the human sensory thresholds.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) kinetics in semisolid samples should be different from that in aqueous and gaseous samples, as convection is negligible in semisolid samples but dominates mass transfer in bulk phases of aqueous and gaseous samples. This study developed a mathematical model for describing SPME kinetics in semisolid samples by considering the diffusion of analytes in two compartments, i.e., the fiber coating and the ever-increasing diffusion domain in the sample matrix. The mathematical model predicted that SPME and the desorption of preloaded analytes from the fiber would be isotropic in semisolid samples, while SPME in semisolid samples would not follow the first order kinetics as in aqueous and gaseous samples. The predictions were proven true in the experiment of four pharmaceuticals in agarose gel. In return, it was observed in the experiment that SPME kinetics would deviate more significantly from the first order kinetics for the analytes with higher partition coefficients between the fiber and the sample matrix, which was well explained by the mathematical model developed in this study. In addition, SPME kinetics predicted by the model coincided well with the experimental results when the diffusion coefficients were at reasonable levels, which demonstrated that the model could be satisfactory for describing SPME kinetics in semisolid samples. The illustration of the nonfirst order SPME kinetics in semisolid samples can be valuable for evaluating the applicability of the existing pre-equilibrium calibration methods in semisolid samples.},

In this work, a computational model was employed to elucidate practical aspects such as efficiency and kinetics of extraction by employing several new geometries. Extraction of a model analyte at static conditions with the configurations, such as thin-film, fiber, coated tip, and nanoparticles, was numerically simulated to obtain an in-depth understanding of the advantages and limitations of each geometry in microextraction and exhaustive modes. The attained results associated with the equilibration time dependency on shape were in good agreement with previously reported experimental observations. They demonstrate that the mass-transfer is highly dependent on the size and shape of the coatings and increases with a decrease in size of the devices particularly rapidly below 10 μm caused by radial diffusion effect. Nevertheless, extractions performed using octadecyl-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles demonstrated that higher enrichment factors are achievable with the use of a fewer number of particles in comparison to factors achieved via exhaustive extraction, where a larger number of particles must be employed, confirming theoretical predictions. The conclusions reached are valid for any extraction method. The results obtained herein are very useful toward the design and optimization of future extraction technologies and approaches.},

	abstract = {Technologies that efficiently integrate the sampling and sample preparation steps with direct introduction to mass spectrometry (MS), providing simple and sensitive analytical workflows as well as capabilities for automation, can generate a great impact in a vast variety of fields, such as in clinical, environmental, and food-science applications. In this study, a novel approach that facilitates direct coupling of Bio-SPME devices to MS using a microfluidic design is presented. This technology, named microfluidic open interface (MOI), which operates under the concept of flow-isolated desorption volume, consists of an open-to-ambient desorption chamber (V ≤ 7 μL) connected to an ionization source. Subsequently, compounds of interest are transported to the ionization source by means of the self-aspiration process intrinsic of these interfaces. Thus, any ionization technology that provides a reliable and constant suction, such as electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), or inductively coupled plasma ionization (ICP), can be hyphenated to MOI. Using this setup, the desorption chamber is used to release target compounds from the coating, while the isolation of the flow enables the ionization source to be continuously fed with solvent, all without the necessity of employment of additional valves. As a proof of concept, the design was applied to an ESI-MS/MS system for experimental validation. Furthermore, numerical simulations were undertaken to provide a detailed understanding of the fluid flow pattern inside the interface, then used to optimize the system for better efficiency. The analytical workflow of the developed Bio-SPME-MOI-MS setup consists of the direct immersion of SPME fibers into the matrix to extract/enrich analytes of interest within a short period of time, followed by a rinsing step with water to remove potentially adhering proteins, salts, and/or other interfering compounds. Next, the fiber is inserted into the MOI for desorption of compounds of interest. Finally, the volume contained in the chamber is drained and moved toward the electrospray needle for ionization and direct introduction to MS. Aiming to validate the technology, the fast determination of selected immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus, and everolimus) from 100 μL of whole blood was assessed. Limits of quantitation in the subppb range were obtained for all studied compounds. Good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.99) and excellent precision, with (8\%) and without (14\%) internal standard correction, were attained.},

The direct immersion (DI) mode of SPME when utilized in conjunction with such extraction phases facilitates extraction of a wide range of analytes from complex matrices without the incurrence of fouling or coating saturation. In this work, mathematical models and computational simulations were employed to investigate the effect of binding components present in complex samples on the recovery of small molecules varying in logP for extractions carried out using the direct immersion approach. The presented findings corroborate that the studied approach indeed enables the extraction of both polar and nonpolar analytes from complex matrices, provided a suitable sorbent is employed. Further results indicated that, in certain cases, the kinetics of extraction of a given analyte in its free form might be dependent on the desorption kinetics of their bound form from matrix components, which might lower total recoveries of analytes with high affinity for the matrix. However, the binding of analytes to matrix components also enables SPME to extract a balanced quantity of different logP analytes, facilitated by multiphase equilibria, with a single extraction device.},

Using a model system, we systematically explored the electrochemical response of all possible positions of single nucleotide mismatches in a set of 25-mer DNA films. These ds-DNA sequences each with a single mismatch at one of the twenty-five positions were bound to gold surfaces through a Au-S linkage and analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in the absence and presence of Zn(2+). We expected a unique response from each mismatched sequence in order to discriminate the mismatch positions. A pattern emerges between the electrochemical signals and mismatch positions. The positions can be grouped broadly into positions that exhibit large differences between matched and mismatched DNA (around positions 5 and 9) and those that exhibit smaller differences (around positions 1, 13 and 23) in the charge transfer resistance ΔR(ct), evaluated by EIS, and the apparent rate constant k(0), evaluated by SECM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the electrochemical response of a single nucleotide mismatch as a function of mismatch positions along an oligonucleotide sequence.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a well-known sampling and sample preparation technique used for a wide variety of analytical applications. As there are various complex processes taking place at the time of extraction that influence the parameters of optimum extraction, a mathematical model and computational simulation describing the SPME process is required for experimentalists to understand and implement the technique without performing multiple costly and time-consuming experiments in the laboratory. In this thesis, a mechanistic mathematical model for the processes occurring in SPME extraction of analyte(s) from an aqueous sample medium is presented. The proposed mechanistic model was validated with experimental data. Several key factors that affect the extraction kinetics, such as sample agitation, fiber coating thickness, and presence of a binding matrix component, are discussed. More interestingly, for the first time, shorter or longer equilibrium times in the presence of a binding matrix component were explained with the help of an asymptotic analysis. Parameters that contribute to the variation of the equilibrium times are discussed, with the assumption that one binding matrix component is present in a static sample. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model captures the phenomena occurring in SPME, leading to a clearer understanding of this process. Therefore, the currently presented model can be used to identify optimum experimental parameters without the need to perform a large number of experiments in the laboratory. 
A calibration approach based on standard chemicals loaded onto an extraction phase (calibrant-loaded extraction phase, CL-EP) has gained popularity in various areas of sample analysis, such as environmental, toxicological, and tissue sampling research areas. In this thesis, the kinetics of calibrant release and analyte uptake between the sample and extraction phase with a finite-element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics® software package. Effect of finite and infinite sample volume conditions, as well as various sample environment parameters such as fluid flow velocity, temperature, and presence of a binding matrix component were investigated in detail with the model in relation to the performance of the calibration. The simulation results demonstrate the suitability of the CL-EP method for analysis of samples at various sample environments. The calibrant-loaded approach can provide both total and free concentrations from a single experiment based on whether the Kes value being used is measured in a matrix-matched sample or in a matrix-free sample, respectively. Total concentrations can also be obtained by utilizing CL-EP in combination with external matrix-matched calibration, which can be employed to automate the sampling process and provide corrections for variations in sample preparation, matrix effects, and detection processes. This approach is also suitable for very small volumes of sample, where addition of an internal standard in the sample is either troublesome or can change the sample characteristics. Although the outcome of this study is applicable to any sampler based on calibrant-loaded liquid or solid extraction phase method, experimental data using a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampler was used to fit our simulation results. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental data reported previously. Moreover, the computational model and numerical simulation presented will aid in the optimization of sampler design and sampling parameters prior to laboratory experiments, which will translate into savings in terms of time and expensive chemicals. 
 Despite the prevalence of porous-particle based coatings used for microextraction techniques, there is inadequate understanding of how extraction parameters influence the extracted amount and quantification of analytes. This is particularly important when extraction is performed with these solid coatings under pre-equilibrium conditions, for instance, with diffusion based rapid calibration approach which is a popular technique for on-site chemical analysis for not requiring any calibration method or internal standards. This study presents a computational model for porous particle-based coatings used in solid phase microextraction. Although the model describes extraction behavior of analytes for both kinetic and equilibrium regime of extraction profile, the critical parameters for the diffusion based rapid sampling were studied using the developed model. Simulations are conducted under variations in both mass transfer and adsorptive surface binding constants, coating capacity, constrained by real-world experimental conditions of finite and infinite sample volume. The model simulation results demonstrated excellent correlation with previously reported experimental data and superior to previous semi-empirical models.   
 In the last chapter of the thesis, a novel SPME coating functionalized with a DNA aptamer for selective enrichment of a low abundance protein from diluted human plasma is described. This approach is based on the covalent immobilization of an aptamer ligand on electrospun microfibers made with the hydrophilic polymer poly(acrylonitrile-co-maleic acid) (PANCMA) on stainless steel rods. A plasma protein, human alpha-thrombin, was employed as a model protein for selective extraction by the developed Apt-SPME probe, and the detection was carried out with liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The SPME probe exhibited highly selective capture, good binding capacity, high stability and good repeatability for the extraction of thrombin. The protein selective probe was employed for direct extraction of thrombin from 20-fold diluted human plasma samples without any other purification. The Apt-SPME method coupled with LC–MS/MS provided a good linear dynamic range of 0.5–50 nM in diluted human plasma with a good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9923), and the detection limit of the proposed method was found to be 0.30 nM. Finally, the Apt-SPME coupled with LC–MS/MS method was successfully utilized for the determination of thrombin in clinical human plasma samples. One shortcoming of the method is its reduced efficiency in undiluted human plasma compared to the standard solution. Nevertheless, this new aptamer affinity-based SPME probe opens up the possibility of selective enrichment of a given targeted protein from complex sample either in vivo or ex vivo.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is an approach to sample preparation that has demonstrated its appropriateness for isolating/enriching analytes present in complex bioﬂuids with minimum sample pretreatment. Several prior in vitro and in vivo studies have used SPME to monitor the concentrations of various drugs and metabolites in blood samples. In this work, we present the results of an investigation into how various levels of hematocrit (Hct) affect SPME recoveries. The matrices for this study consisted of whole blood samples that had been adjusted at three different Hct levels (20\%, 45\%, and 70\%), and the selected model compounds were drugs with different physicochemical characteristics (log P range from 0.33 to 6.36). In addition, two experimental setups were employed to conduct the extractions: hydrophilic lipophilic balanced (HLB) coated SPME devices (HLB-D) at 1500 rpm (vortex agitation), and mixed mode SPME ﬁbres (MM-F) at 400 rpm (orbital shaking agitation). Our results demonstrated that the Hct effect in SPME is dependent on the analytes of interest, and that different outcomes can be attained by altering experimental conditions, such as coating type, convection, and extraction time. Interestingly, a target compound's relative afﬁnity for the matrix components and for the coating material proved to be one of the main factors that determine the ﬁnal effect that different erythrocyte levels have on SPME recoveries. Finally, although the Hct content affects each analyte differently and the ﬁnal Hct effect depends on the experimental parameters, matrix variability can be corrected by using appropriate internal standards, thereby resulting in correct quantiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {We present the kinetics of calibrant release and analyte uptake between the sample and calibrant-loaded extraction phase, CL-EP, with a ﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics software package. Eﬀect of ﬁnite and inﬁnite sample volume conditions, as well as various sample environment parameters such as ﬂuid ﬂow velocity, temperature, and presence of a binding matrix component were investigated in detail with the model in relation to the performance of the calibration. The simulation results supported by experimental data demonstrate the suitability of the CL-EP method for analysis of samples with variation of the sample environment parameters. The calibrant-loaded approach can provide both total and free concentrations from a single experiment based on whether the partition coeﬃcient (Kes) value being used is measured in a matrix-matched sample or in a matrix-free sample, respectively. Total concentrations can also be obtained by utilizing CL-EP in combination with external matrix-matched calibrations, which can be employed to automate the sampling process and provide corrections for variations in sample preparation, matrix eﬀects, and detection processes. This approach is also suitable for very small volumes of sample, where addition of an internal standard in the sample is either troublesome or can change the sample characteristics.},

	abstract = {The currently presented research investigated the performance of matrix compatible PDMS-overcoated ﬁbers (PDMS-DVB/PDMS) as compared to unmodiﬁed PDMS/ DVB coatings using aqueous samples and employing a wide range of analyte polarities, molecular weights, and functionalities. In the ﬁrst part of the work, a kinetic approach was taken to investigate the eﬀect of the PDMS outer layer on the uptake rate of analytes during the mass transfer process. In short, the results can be simpliﬁed into two models: (1) the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the coating and (2) the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the aqueous diﬀusional boundary layer. For polar compounds, according to the theoretical discussion, the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the coating; therefore, the outer PDMS layer inﬂuences the uptake rate into the matrix compatible coatings. On the other hand, for nonpolar compounds, the rate-limiting step of the uptake process is diﬀusion through the aqueous diﬀusional boundary layer; as such, the overcoated PDMS does not aﬀect uptake rate into the matrix-compatible coatings as compared to DVB/PDMS ﬁbers. From a thermodynamic point of view, the calculated ﬁber constants further corroborate the hypothesis that the additional PDMS layer does not impair the extraction phase capacity.},

	abstract = {The development of matrix compatible coatings for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has enabled direct extraction of analytes from complex sample matrices. The direct immersion (DI) mode of SPME when utilized in conjunction with such extraction phases facilitates extraction of a wide range of analytes from complex matrices without the incurrence of fouling or coating saturation. In this work, mathematical models and computational simulations were employed to investigate the eﬀect of binding components present in complex samples on the recovery of small molecules varying in logP for extractions carried out using the direct immersion approach. The presented ﬁndings corroborate that the studied approach indeed enables the extraction of both polar and nonpolar analytes from complex matrices, provided a suitable sorbent is employed. Further results indicated that, in certain cases, the kinetics of extraction of a given analyte in its free form might be dependent on the desorption kinetics of their bound form from matrix components, which might lower total recoveries of analytes with high aﬃnity for the matrix. However, the binding of analytes to matrix components also enables SPME to extract a balanced quantity of diﬀerent logP analytes, facilitated by multiphase equilibria, with a single extraction device.},

	abstract = {The aim of the current study is the establishment of Green Analytical Chemistry strategies for water analysis by elimination/reduction of hazardous chemicals, energy consumption, and waste generation throughout the entire analytical workﬂow. The ﬁrst approach introduced in this manuscript consists of addition of water to a sampling vessel that contains a thin ﬁlm microextraction (TFME) device, followed by removal of the device after equilibration, and subsequent quantiﬁcation of the extracted components by thermal desorption GC/MS. In this approach, namely the in-bottle TFME approach, analyte-loss associated errors that stem from analyte adherence to glass surfaces and/or degradation are avoided as extraction occurs in situ, while analytes are isolated from a complex matrix that contains degradation agents (bacteria, oxidizing or reducing species, etc.). This procedure also circumvents the splitting of original samples into sub-samples. The second approach involves the use of portable TFME devices that facilitate on-site extraction of compounds, therefore eliminating the use of collection vessels, a factor known to potentially introduce errors into analysis. The herein described procedure involves attachment of the TFME device to drill accessories, analyte extraction via direct immersion into sampled site, and subsequent on-site instrumental analysis, which is carried out with the use of a portable GC/MS containing an appropriate thermal desorption interface, or alternatively, by transferring the membrane to the laboratory for bench-top GC/MS analysis. To facilitate a better understanding of the processes governing the developed approaches, modeling by COMSOL Multiphysics® software was performed. The ﬁndings of this study were applied for further method optimization, and the optimized developed methods were then applied for on-site surface water analyses. Finally, the greenness of the developed methods was evaluated with use of the eco-scale assessment, with obtained scores compared to that of the US EPA 8270 method.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is an approach to sample preparation that has demonstrated its appropriateness for isolating/enriching analytes present in complex biofluids with minimum sample pre-treatment. Several prior in vitro and in vivo studies have used SPME to monitor the concentrations of various drugs and metabolites in blood samples. In this work, we present the results of an investigation into how various levels of hematocrit (Hct) affect SPME recoveries. The matrices for this study consisted of whole blood samples that had been adjusted at three different Hct levels (20\%, 45\%, and 70\%), and the selected model compounds were drugs with different physicochemical characteristics (log P range from 0.33 to 6.36). In addition, two experimental setups were employed to conduct the extractions: hydrophilic lipophilic balanced (HLB) coated SPME devices (HLB-D) at 1500 rpm (vortex agitation), and mixed mode SPME fibres (MM-F) at 400 rpm (orbital shaking agitation). Our results demonstrated that the Hct effect in SPME is dependent on the analytes of interest, and that different outcomes can be attained by altering experimental conditions, such as coating type, convection, and extraction time. Interestingly, a target compound's relative affinity for the matrix components and for the coating material proved to be one of the main factors that determine the final effect that different erythrocyte levels have on SPME recoveries. Finally, although the Hct content affects each analyte differently and the final Hct effect depends on the experimental parameters, matrix variability can be corrected by using appropriate internal standards, thereby resulting in correct quantification.},
