	abstract = {An alternative strategy to increase mass transfer entails geometry optimization of the extraction systems including design of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) probes. In this work, a computational model was employed to elucidate practical aspects such as efficiency and kinetics of extraction by employing several new geometries. Extraction of a model analyte at static conditions with the configurations, such as thin-film, fiber, coated tip, and nanoparticles, was numerically simulated to obtain an in-depth understanding of the advantages and limitations of each geometry in microextraction and exhaustive modes. The attained results associated with the equilibration time dependency on shape were in good agreement with previously reported experimental observations. They demonstrate that the mass-transfer is highly dependent on the size and shape of the coatings and increases with a decrease in size of the devices particularly rapidly below 10 μm caused by radial diffusion effect. Nevertheless, extractions performed using octadecyl-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles demonstrated that higher enrichment factors are achievable with the use of a fewer number of particles in comparison to factors achieved via exhaustive extraction, where a larger number of particles must be employed, confirming theoretical predictions. The conclusions reached are valid for any extraction method. The results obtained herein are very useful toward the design and optimization of future extraction technologies and approaches.},

	abstract = {Technologies that efficiently integrate the sampling and sample preparation steps with direct introduction to mass spectrometry (MS), providing simple and sensitive analytical workflows as well as capabilities for automation, can generate a great impact in a vast variety of fields, such as in clinical, environmental, and food-science applications. In this study, a novel approach that facilitates direct coupling of Bio-SPME devices to MS using a microfluidic design is presented. This technology, named microfluidic open interface (MOI), which operates under the concept of flow-isolated desorption volume, consists of an open-to-ambient desorption chamber (V ≤ 7 μL) connected to an ionization source. Subsequently, compounds of interest are transported to the ionization source by means of the self-aspiration process intrinsic of these interfaces. Thus, any ionization technology that provides a reliable and constant suction, such as electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), or inductively coupled plasma ionization (ICP), can be hyphenated to MOI. Using this setup, the desorption chamber is used to release target compounds from the coating, while the isolation of the flow enables the ionization source to be continuously fed with solvent, all without the necessity of employment of additional valves. As a proof of concept, the design was applied to an ESI-MS/MS system for experimental validation. Furthermore, numerical simulations were undertaken to provide a detailed understanding of the fluid flow pattern inside the interface, then used to optimize the system for better efficiency. The analytical workflow of the developed Bio-SPME-MOI-MS setup consists of the direct immersion of SPME fibers into the matrix to extract/enrich analytes of interest within a short period of time, followed by a rinsing step with water to remove potentially adhering proteins, salts, and/or other interfering compounds. Next, the fiber is inserted into the MOI for desorption of compounds of interest. Finally, the volume contained in the chamber is drained and moved toward the electrospray needle for ionization and direct introduction to MS. Aiming to validate the technology, the fast determination of selected immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus, and everolimus) from 100 μL of whole blood was assessed. Limits of quantitation in the subppb range were obtained for all studied compounds. Good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.99) and excellent precision, with (8\%) and without (14\%) internal standard correction, were attained.},

	abstract = {While there are a number of electrochemical methods reported that enable the detection of single nucleotide mismatches, the determination of mismatch position in a double stranded DNA remains an unsolved challenge. Using a model system, we systematically explored the electrochemical response of all possible positions of single nucleotide mismatches in a set of 25-mer DNA films. These ds-DNA sequences each with a single mismatch at one of the twenty-five positions were bound to gold surfaces through a Au-S linkage and analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in the absence and presence of Zn(2+). We expected a unique response from each mismatched sequence in order to discriminate the mismatch positions. A pattern emerges between the electrochemical signals and mismatch positions. The positions can be grouped broadly into positions that exhibit large differences between matched and mismatched DNA (around positions 5 and 9) and those that exhibit smaller differences (around positions 1, 13 and 23) in the charge transfer resistance ΔR(ct), evaluated by EIS, and the apparent rate constant k(0), evaluated by SECM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the electrochemical response of a single nucleotide mismatch as a function of mismatch positions along an oligonucleotide sequence.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a well-known sampling and sample preparation technique used for a wide variety of analytical applications. As there are various complex processes taking place at the time of extraction that influence the parameters of optimum extraction, a mathematical model and computational simulation describing the SPME process is required for experimentalists to understand and implement the technique without performing multiple costly and time-consuming experiments in the laboratory. In this thesis, a mechanistic mathematical model for the processes occurring in SPME extraction of analyte(s) from an aqueous sample medium is presented. The proposed mechanistic model was validated with experimental data. Several key factors that affect the extraction kinetics, such as sample agitation, fiber coating thickness, and presence of a binding matrix component, are discussed. More interestingly, for the first time, shorter or longer equilibrium times in the presence of a binding matrix component were explained with the help of an asymptotic analysis. Parameters that contribute to the variation of the equilibrium times are discussed, with the assumption that one binding matrix component is present in a static sample. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model captures the phenomena occurring in SPME, leading to a clearer understanding of this process. Therefore, the currently presented model can be used to identify optimum experimental parameters without the need to perform a large number of experiments in the laboratory. 
A calibration approach based on standard chemicals loaded onto an extraction phase (calibrant-loaded extraction phase, CL-EP) has gained popularity in various areas of sample analysis, such as environmental, toxicological, and tissue sampling research areas. In this thesis, the kinetics of calibrant release and analyte uptake between the sample and extraction phase with a finite-element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics® software package. Effect of finite and infinite sample volume conditions, as well as various sample environment parameters such as fluid flow velocity, temperature, and presence of a binding matrix component were investigated in detail with the model in relation to the performance of the calibration. The simulation results demonstrate the suitability of the CL-EP method for analysis of samples at various sample environments. The calibrant-loaded approach can provide both total and free concentrations from a single experiment based on whether the Kes value being used is measured in a matrix-matched sample or in a matrix-free sample, respectively. Total concentrations can also be obtained by utilizing CL-EP in combination with external matrix-matched calibration, which can be employed to automate the sampling process and provide corrections for variations in sample preparation, matrix effects, and detection processes. This approach is also suitable for very small volumes of sample, where addition of an internal standard in the sample is either troublesome or can change the sample characteristics. Although the outcome of this study is applicable to any sampler based on calibrant-loaded liquid or solid extraction phase method, experimental data using a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampler was used to fit our simulation results. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental data reported previously. Moreover, the computational model and numerical simulation presented will aid in the optimization of sampler design and sampling parameters prior to laboratory experiments, which will translate into savings in terms of time and expensive chemicals. 
 Despite the prevalence of porous-particle based coatings used for microextraction techniques, there is inadequate understanding of how extraction parameters influence the extracted amount and quantification of analytes. This is particularly important when extraction is performed with these solid coatings under pre-equilibrium conditions, for instance, with diffusion based rapid calibration approach which is a popular technique for on-site chemical analysis for not requiring any calibration method or internal standards. This study presents a computational model for porous particle-based coatings used in solid phase microextraction. Although the model describes extraction behavior of analytes for both kinetic and equilibrium regime of extraction profile, the critical parameters for the diffusion based rapid sampling were studied using the developed model. Simulations are conducted under variations in both mass transfer and adsorptive surface binding constants, coating capacity, constrained by real-world experimental conditions of finite and infinite sample volume. The model simulation results demonstrated excellent correlation with previously reported experimental data and superior to previous semi-empirical models.   
 In the last chapter of the thesis, a novel SPME coating functionalized with a DNA aptamer for selective enrichment of a low abundance protein from diluted human plasma is described. This approach is based on the covalent immobilization of an aptamer ligand on electrospun microfibers made with the hydrophilic polymer poly(acrylonitrile-co-maleic acid) (PANCMA) on stainless steel rods. A plasma protein, human alpha-thrombin, was employed as a model protein for selective extraction by the developed Apt-SPME probe, and the detection was carried out with liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The SPME probe exhibited highly selective capture, good binding capacity, high stability and good repeatability for the extraction of thrombin. The protein selective probe was employed for direct extraction of thrombin from 20-fold diluted human plasma samples without any other purification. The Apt-SPME method coupled with LC–MS/MS provided a good linear dynamic range of 0.5–50 nM in diluted human plasma with a good correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9923), and the detection limit of the proposed method was found to be 0.30 nM. Finally, the Apt-SPME coupled with LC–MS/MS method was successfully utilized for the determination of thrombin in clinical human plasma samples. One shortcoming of the method is its reduced efficiency in undiluted human plasma compared to the standard solution. Nevertheless, this new aptamer affinity-based SPME probe opens up the possibility of selective enrichment of a given targeted protein from complex sample either in vivo or ex vivo.},

	abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is an approach to sample preparation that has demonstrated its appropriateness for isolating/enriching analytes present in complex bioﬂuids with minimum sample pretreatment. Several prior in vitro and in vivo studies have used SPME to monitor the concentrations of various drugs and metabolites in blood samples. In this work, we present the results of an investigation into how various levels of hematocrit (Hct) affect SPME recoveries. The matrices for this study consisted of whole blood samples that had been adjusted at three different Hct levels (20\%, 45\%, and 70\%), and the selected model compounds were drugs with different physicochemical characteristics (log P range from 0.33 to 6.36). In addition, two experimental setups were employed to conduct the extractions: hydrophilic lipophilic balanced (HLB) coated SPME devices (HLB-D) at 1500 rpm (vortex agitation), and mixed mode SPME ﬁbres (MM-F) at 400 rpm (orbital shaking agitation). Our results demonstrated that the Hct effect in SPME is dependent on the analytes of interest, and that different outcomes can be attained by altering experimental conditions, such as coating type, convection, and extraction time. Interestingly, a target compound's relative afﬁnity for the matrix components and for the coating material proved to be one of the main factors that determine the ﬁnal effect that different erythrocyte levels have on SPME recoveries. Finally, although the Hct content affects each analyte differently and the ﬁnal Hct effect depends on the experimental parameters, matrix variability can be corrected by using appropriate internal standards, thereby resulting in correct quantiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {We present the kinetics of calibrant release and analyte uptake between the sample and calibrant-loaded extraction phase, CL-EP, with a ﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics software package. Eﬀect of ﬁnite and inﬁnite sample volume conditions, as well as various sample environment parameters such as ﬂuid ﬂow velocity, temperature, and presence of a binding matrix component were investigated in detail with the model in relation to the performance of the calibration. The simulation results supported by experimental data demonstrate the suitability of the CL-EP method for analysis of samples with variation of the sample environment parameters. The calibrant-loaded approach can provide both total and free concentrations from a single experiment based on whether the partition coeﬃcient (Kes) value being used is measured in a matrix-matched sample or in a matrix-free sample, respectively. Total concentrations can also be obtained by utilizing CL-EP in combination with external matrix-matched calibrations, which can be employed to automate the sampling process and provide corrections for variations in sample preparation, matrix eﬀects, and detection processes. This approach is also suitable for very small volumes of sample, where addition of an internal standard in the sample is either troublesome or can change the sample characteristics.},

	abstract = {The currently presented research investigated the performance of matrix compatible PDMS-overcoated ﬁbers (PDMS-DVB/PDMS) as compared to unmodiﬁed PDMS/ DVB coatings using aqueous samples and employing a wide range of analyte polarities, molecular weights, and functionalities. In the ﬁrst part of the work, a kinetic approach was taken to investigate the eﬀect of the PDMS outer layer on the uptake rate of analytes during the mass transfer process. In short, the results can be simpliﬁed into two models: (1) the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the coating and (2) the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the aqueous diﬀusional boundary layer. For polar compounds, according to the theoretical discussion, the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the coating; therefore, the outer PDMS layer inﬂuences the uptake rate into the matrix compatible coatings. On the other hand, for nonpolar compounds, the rate-limiting step of the uptake process is diﬀusion through the aqueous diﬀusional boundary layer; as such, the overcoated PDMS does not aﬀect uptake rate into the matrix-compatible coatings as compared to DVB/PDMS ﬁbers. From a thermodynamic point of view, the calculated ﬁber constants further corroborate the hypothesis that the additional PDMS layer does not impair the extraction phase capacity.},

	abstract = {The development of matrix compatible coatings for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has enabled direct extraction of analytes from complex sample matrices. The direct immersion (DI) mode of SPME when utilized in conjunction with such extraction phases facilitates extraction of a wide range of analytes from complex matrices without the incurrence of fouling or coating saturation. In this work, mathematical models and computational simulations were employed to investigate the eﬀect of binding components present in complex samples on the recovery of small molecules varying in logP for extractions carried out using the direct immersion approach. The presented ﬁndings corroborate that the studied approach indeed enables the extraction of both polar and nonpolar analytes from complex matrices, provided a suitable sorbent is employed. Further results indicated that, in certain cases, the kinetics of extraction of a given analyte in its free form might be dependent on the desorption kinetics of their bound form from matrix components, which might lower total recoveries of analytes with high aﬃnity for the matrix. However, the binding of analytes to matrix components also enables SPME to extract a balanced quantity of diﬀerent logP analytes, facilitated by multiphase equilibria, with a single extraction device.},

	abstract = {The aim of the current study is the establishment of Green Analytical Chemistry strategies for water analysis by elimination/reduction of hazardous chemicals, energy consumption, and waste generation throughout the entire analytical workﬂow. The ﬁrst approach introduced in this manuscript consists of addition of water to a sampling vessel that contains a thin ﬁlm microextraction (TFME) device, followed by removal of the device after equilibration, and subsequent quantiﬁcation of the extracted components by thermal desorption GC/MS. In this approach, namely the in-bottle TFME approach, analyte-loss associated errors that stem from analyte adherence to glass surfaces and/or degradation are avoided as extraction occurs in situ, while analytes are isolated from a complex matrix that contains degradation agents (bacteria, oxidizing or reducing species, etc.). This procedure also circumvents the splitting of original samples into sub-samples. The second approach involves the use of portable TFME devices that facilitate on-site extraction of compounds, therefore eliminating the use of collection vessels, a factor known to potentially introduce errors into analysis. The herein described procedure involves attachment of the TFME device to drill accessories, analyte extraction via direct immersion into sampled site, and subsequent on-site instrumental analysis, which is carried out with the use of a portable GC/MS containing an appropriate thermal desorption interface, or alternatively, by transferring the membrane to the laboratory for bench-top GC/MS analysis. To facilitate a better understanding of the processes governing the developed approaches, modeling by COMSOL Multiphysics® software was performed. The ﬁndings of this study were applied for further method optimization, and the optimized developed methods were then applied for on-site surface water analyses. Finally, the greenness of the developed methods was evaluated with use of the eco-scale assessment, with obtained scores compared to that of the US EPA 8270 method.},
