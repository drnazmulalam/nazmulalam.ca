My research focuses on analytical method development and validation for various samples. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (high resolution and triple quadruple) are the primary instruments for the analysis. During the PhD research, I have developed mathematical modeles for sample extraction with solid phase microextraction technique (SPME). Web development and online teaching is my hobby.
