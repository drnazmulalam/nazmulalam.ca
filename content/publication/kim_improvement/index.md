abstract: "Condensed-tannin gel adsorbent has been modified through the ammonia treatment to introduce amino groups, which have higher affinity for soft metal ions than hydroxy groups, within the gel structure. This modification resulted in the drastic enhancement of Pd(II) adsorbability in chloride media."
