	abstract = {A 1,2-diaminocyclohexane–Pd complex was immobilized onto the surface of silica gel and investigated as a catalyst for Heck coupling reactions. The immobilized catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity in the coupling of activated and nonactivated aryl substrates with various acrylates. Moreover, the catalyst was air-stable that could be recycled and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.},
