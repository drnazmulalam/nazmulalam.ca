abstract: "The development of new support and geometries of solid phase microextraction (SPME), including metal fiber assemblies, coated-tip, and thin film microextraction (TFME) (i.e. self-supported, fabric and blade supported), as well as their effects on diffusion and extraction rate of analytes were discussed in the current review. Application of main techniques widely used for preparation of a variety of coating materials of SPME, including sol-gel technique, electrochemical and electrospinning methods as well as the available commercial coatings, were presented. Advantages and limitations of each technique from several aspects, such as range of application, biocompatibility, availability in different geometrical configurations, method of preparation, incorporation of various materials to tune the coating properties, and thermal and physical stability, were also investigated. Future perspectives of each technique to improve the efficiency and stability of the coatings were also summarized. Some interesting materials including ionic liquids (ILs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and particle loaded coatings were briefly presented."
