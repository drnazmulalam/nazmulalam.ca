	abstract = {A palladium (Pd) catalyst was prepared by immobilization of a 1,2-diaminocyclohexane based Pd-complex onto amorphous silica gel and its applications as a heterogeneous catalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions are described. The catalyst was highly efficient, reusable and air-stable.},
