abstract: "The currently presented research investigated the performance of matrix compatible PDMS-overcoated ﬁbers (PDMS-DVB/PDMS) as compared to unmodiﬁed PDMS/ DVB coatings using aqueous samples and employing a wide range of analyte polarities, molecular weights, and functionalities. In the ﬁrst part of the work, a kinetic approach was taken to investigate the eﬀect of the PDMS outer layer on the uptake rate of analytes during the mass transfer process. In short, the results can be simpliﬁed into two models: (1) the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the coating and (2) the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the aqueous diﬀusional boundary layer. For polar compounds, according to the theoretical discussion, the rate-limiting step is the diﬀusion through the coating; therefore, the outer PDMS layer inﬂuences the uptake rate into the matrix compatible coatings. On the other hand, for nonpolar compounds, the rate-limiting step of the uptake process is diﬀusion through the aqueous diﬀusional boundary layer; as such, the overcoated PDMS does not aﬀect uptake rate into the matrix-compatible coatings as compared to DVB/PDMS ﬁbers. From a thermodynamic point of view, the calculated ﬁber constants further corroborate the hypothesis that the additional PDMS layer does not impair the extraction phase capacity."
